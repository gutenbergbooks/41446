<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>Dear Boys and Girls,&mdash;Let us hope
that none of you has been so unfortunate
as to have missed the pleasure of watching
sometime or other a puppet show. Probably
Punch and Judy is the one you know
best, but there are many others with jolly
little fellows who dance in and out of all
sorts of adventures. So you can imagine
Pinocchio, the hero of this book, as one of
those lively puppets. And, in case you have
never read the earlier book about him, you
will want to know something of what happened
to him before you meet him in these
pages.</p>

<p>One day a poor carpenter, called Master
Cherry, began to cut up a piece of wood to
make a table-leg of it when, to his utmost
amazement, the piece of wood cried out,
"Do not strike me so hard!" The frightened
carpenter stopped for a moment, and
when he began again and struck the wood
a blow with his ax the voice cried out once
more, "Oh, oh! you have hurt me so!"
The carpenter was now so terrified that he
was only too glad to turn the piece of wood
over to a neighbor, Papa Geppetto, who
cut it up into the shape of a boy puppet,
painted it, and named it Pinocchio&mdash;which
means "a piece of pinewood." As soon as
he had finished making him, Pinocchio
grabbed the old man's wig off his head and
started in to play tricks. Papa Geppetto
then taught the puppet to walk, and when
naughty Pinocchio discovered he could use
his legs, he ran away. Then began all
kinds of adventures, and Pinocchio was
sometimes naughty and selfish, and sometimes
kind and considerate, but always
funny and jolly.</p>

<p>In this new book Pinocchio's heart has
grown through love and consideration for
others, so that he becomes a real boy and
takes part in the war to help his beautiful
country, Italy.</p>

Heart and Had Become a Real Boy</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1">1</a></span></p>

<p>He yawned, stuck out his tongue and
licked the end of his nose, opened his
eyes, shut them again, opened them once
more and rubbed them vigorously with the
back of his hand, jumped up, and then sat
down on the sofa, listening intently for
several minutes, after which he scratched
his noddle solemnly. When Pinocchio
scratched his head in this way you could be
sure that there was trouble in the air. And
so there was. The room was empty, the
windows closed, and the door as well; no
noise came from the still quiet street; a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
deep silence filled the air, yet there, right
there, close to him, he heard queer sounds
like blows&mdash;tick-tock ... tick-tock ...
tick-tock ... tick-tock.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/im_016.jpg" width="163" height="334" alt="Tick-Tock" />
</div>

<p>It sounded like some
one who was amusing
himself by rapping with
his knuckles on a wooden
box&mdash;tick-tock ... tick-tock
... tick-tock.</p>

<p>"But who is it?" called
out the puppet, suddenly,
jumping down
from the sofa and running
to peer into every
corner of the room.
When he had knocked
over the chest, rummaged
the wardrobe
with the mirror, upset
the little table, turned over the chairs,
pulled the pictures off the walls, and torn
down the window-curtains, he found himself
seated on the floor in the middle of
the room, dead tired, his face all smeared
with dust and spider-webs, his shirt in tatters,
his tongue hanging out like a pointer's
returning from the hunt. Yet there, close
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
to him, he still heard that strange tick-tock
... tick-tock ... tick-tock ... and
it seemed as if those mysterious fingers were
rapping even more quickly upon the mysterious
wooden box. Pinocchio would have
pulled his hair out in desperation if Papa
Geppetto hadn't forgotten to make him any.
But as the desperation of puppets lasts just
about as long as the joy of poor human
beings, Pinocchio, laying his right forefinger
on the point of his magnificent nose, calmly
remarked:</p>

<p>"Let me argue this out. There is no one
else in here but me. I am keeping perfectly
quiet, not even drawing a long breath, yet
the noise keeps up.... Then, since it is
not I who am making the noise, some one
else must be making it, and as no one outside
me is making it, whatever makes it
must be inside me."</p>

<p>This seemed reasonable, but Pinocchio,
who had not expected he would come to
such a conclusion, gave a start, kicked
violently, and began to roll around on the
ground, yelling as if he would split his
throat: "Help! Help!" The thought had
suddenly come to him that during the night
a mouse had jumped into his mouth and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
down into his stomach and was searching
about in it for some way to get out. But
the quieter he kept the noisier grew the
tick-tock; in fact, so loud that it seemed
to cut off his breath. Fear made him
calm.</p>

<p>"Let me argue this out," he said again,
laying his forefinger against his nose. "It
cannot be a mouse; the movement is too
regular, so regular that if I weren't sure
that I went to bed without supper I should
think I had swallowed Papa Geppetto's
watch by mistake.... Hm! If he hadn't
told me time and time again that I am only
a little puppet without a heart I should
almost believe that I had one down inside
me, and that this tick-tock were indeed ..."</p>

<p>"Just so!"</p>

<p>"Who said 'Just so'? Who said 'Just
so'?" called Pinocchio, looking around in
terror. Naturally no one answered him.</p>

<p>"Hm! Did I dream it?" he asked himself.
"And even if there is any one who
thinks he can frighten me with his 'just
so' he will find himself much mistaken.
A brave boy does not know what fear is,
and I begin to think ...</p>

<p>"'Just so' or not 'just so,' if any one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
has anything to say to me let him come forward
and he will learn what kind of blows
I can give."</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/im_019.jpg" width="208" height="331" alt="Pinocchio in the mirror" />
</div>

<p>He turned round and stepped back a
few steps. It seemed to him that some
one was making a threatening gesture at
him. Without
hesitating a
moment, he
rushed forward
with his head
down, thrashing
out blows
like a madman.
Then he heard
a terrible
smashing of
glass. Pinocchio
had hit
out at his own
image in the
wardrobe mirror,
which naturally
was
shattered to
bits. There is no need for me to tell
you how he felt, because you will have no
trouble in picturing it for yourselves.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span></p>

<p>"But how did I come to make such a
blunder?" he asked himself, as soon as he
had recovered from his surprise. "How did
I happen not to recognize myself in the
mirror? Am I really so changed...?
Can I indeed be changed into a real little
boy or am I a puppet as I always was?"</p>

<p>"Just so! Just so! Just so!"</p>

<p>This time there could be no doubt about
it. Pinocchio sprang toward the window,
opened it, and stuck his head out. There
below, a few feet lower down, was a beautiful
terrace covered with flowering plants.
In the midst of the plants was a stand, and
on the stand a magnificent green parrot
who just at that moment was scratching
under his beak with his claw, and looking
around him with one eye open. Down in
the street below there was not a soul to be
seen.</p>

<p>"Oh, you ugly beast! Was it you who
was chattering 'just so, just so, just so'?"</p>

<p>The parrot burst out into a crazy laugh
and began to sing in his cracked voice:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Coccorito wants to know</p>
<p>Who the glass gave such a blow.</p>
<p>Coccorito knows it well</p>
<p>And the master he will tell."</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span></p>

<p>"Hah! Hah! Hah!" And he burst out
into another guffaw. Patience, which is the
only heritage of donkeys, was certainly not
Pinocchio's
principal
virtue. Moreover,
the parrot
laughed in such
a rude manner
that he would
have annoyed
Jove himself.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/im_021.jpg" width="210" height="265" alt="The Parrot" />
</div>
<p>"Stop it,
idiot!"</p>

<p>"Idiot, idiot,
'yot, 'yot."</p>

<p>"Beast!"</p>

<p>"Beast!"</p>

<p>"Take care ..."</p>

<p>"Take ca-a-a-re."</p>

<p>"I'll give it to you."</p>

<p>"You, you, you."</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!</p>
<p>Who the glass gave such a blow?</p>
<p>Coccorito knows it well</p>
<p>And the master he will tell."</p>
</div></div>

<p>"Will you? I'll make you shut up.
Take this, you horrid beast!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span></p>

<p>There was a large terra-cotta pot with a
fine plant of basil in it standing on the
window-sill, and the furious Pinocchio seized
it in both hands and hurled it down with
all his force. Coccorito would have come
to a sad ending if the god of parrots had
not protected his topknot. The flower-pot
grazed the stand and was shattered against
the marble parapet, and the pieces, falling
down, hit against the large stained-glass
window opening on to the terrace and
broke it.</p>

<p>Pinocchio, who could hardly believe that
he had done so much damage, stood still
a moment and gazed stupidly at the pile
of broken pieces and at the parrot, who
laughed as if he would burst. But when
Pinocchio saw a big officer rush angrily
over the terrace, with his hair brushed up
on his head, a huge mustache beneath his
curved nose, and a thick switch in his hand,
he was seized with such a fright that he
threw over his shoulders the first thing in
the way of clothing he could lay his hand
on, rushed to the door, opened it with a
kick, ran through a small room adjoining,
sped down the stairs at breakneck speed,
flung open the street door and&mdash;Heavens!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
He felt a violent blow on his stomach and,
as if hurled from a catapult, he was thrown
into the air and fell down the rest of the
steps, his legs out before him. But he
didn't stay still when he got
to the bottom. He sprang
up like a jack-in-the-box,
rubbed himself on the injured
part, and was off again. He
seemed to see some one strolling
there in the middle of the
street; he thought he heard
himself called twice or thrice
by a well-known voice, but
the fear which was driving
him bade him run, and he
ran with all the strength he
had in his body.</p>

<div class="figright">

<p>Poor Papa Geppetto! It
was indeed he who was strolling
in the middle of the street
and who, seeing Pinocchio
flying out of the house like a madman,
wrapped in a flowered chintz curtain, had
called to him imploringly.</p>

<p>And so it was&mdash;in his hurry Pinocchio
had thrown over his shoulders one of the
curtains of his room, and if I must tell you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
all the truth, he was a perfectly comical
sight. Soon Pinocchio had a string of people
at his heels crying out: "Catch the
madman! Give it to the madman!"</p>

<p>Catch him! That was easy to say, but
it was no easy matter to grab hold of the
rascal. Indeed, his pursuers were soon
weary, and Pinocchio might have thought
himself safe if a dog hadn't suddenly joined
in the game. It was a large jet-black poodle
that had come from no one knew where.
With a couple of bounds he had caught up
with Pinocchio and had seized the curtain
in his teeth and was dragging it through
the dust. Suddenly he stiffened on his
four legs and Pinocchio gave a little whirl
and found himself face to face with the
animal.</p>

<p>"Ho, ho, ho! What do I see? Oh, Medoro,
don't you recognize me? Give me your paw."</p>

<p>Medoro growled and shook the curtain
violently, which was still knotted about
Pinocchio's waist. It was only then that
he noticed the strange covering he had on
and burst out laughing.</p>

<p>"Oh, Medoro! What do you really want
to do with this rag? I'll give it to you
willingly."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span></p>

<p>He had scarcely undone the knots when
Medoro made a spring and was off down
the street they had come, the curtain in his
teeth. The puppet stood there, quite upset.
Medoro had given him a lesson. The dog
that had been so friendly had turned on him
and, after having pulled the miserable old
curtain off him, had made off without paying
any further attention to his old friend.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/im_025.jpg" width="350" height="257" alt="The dog had turned on him" />
</div>

<p>"A fine way of doing!" he grumbled.
"I'll catch cold running around after that
rag. Papa Geppetto won't even thank him....
I had better tried to mend the mirror
of the wardrobe or the general's window."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span></p>

<p>The thought of all the troubles he had
caused the poor man in so short a time
made Pinocchio rather melancholy, and two
big tears shone in his bright little eyes. But
suddenly he sighed a deep sigh, shrugged
his shoulders several times, and with his
head high and his hands on his hips, set off
again on his way, whistling a popular song.</p>

<p>He had not gone a hundred steps when
he stopped suddenly, cocked his ear, listened
a moment quietly, and then flung
himself into the fields which bordered the
street. The wind brought from far off
the gay notes of a military band.</p>

<p>There was a huge crowd, but Pinocchio
didn't give that a thought, in spite of the
fact that he was very tired with his long
run. By pushing and poking and kicks in
the shins he got up into the front row.
Soldiers were passing. At the head was a
company of bicycle sharpshooters (bersaglieri),
then the band, then the regiment, the
Red Cross ambulance, and soldiers, and a
long line of sappers. Everybody clapped,
threw kisses and flowers, and overwhelmed
the bersaglieri with little gifts. The soldiers
broke ranks and mingled with the
crowd and answered the applause with loud
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
cheers for Italy, the King, and the Army.
Some of them marched along in the midst
of their families; weeping mothers begged
their sons to be careful; the fathers bade
them be brave, reminding them of the
fighting in '48, '66, '70&mdash;the glorious years
of our emancipation. The little boys kept
close to their fathers, proud to see them
armed like the heroes of old legends, and
many of the girls besought their sweethearts:
"Write to me, won't you? Every
day I want you to write to me. If I don't
get letters from you I shall think that you
are dead and I shall weep so bitterly."</p>

<p>Dead! This word affected Pinocchio so
that suddenly he felt his heart beating
loudly&mdash;that strange tick-tock, tick-tock,
tick-tock which had startled him earlier
that morning.</p>

<p>Dead? "Oh! where are they going?" he
asked a sprightly old man who was standing
near by, shouting, "Hurrah for Italy!"
as if he were a boy.</p>

<p>"They are going to the war."</p>

<p>"Are they really off to war? Will they
fire only powder from their guns, or real,
lead bullets, too?"</p>

<p>"Indeed yes, real bullets, too."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span></p>

<p>"And will they all die?"</p>

<p>"We hope not all of them&mdash;but they are
going to fight for the honor and greatness
of their country, and he who dies for his
country may die happy."</p>

<p>Pinocchio did not breathe. He scratched
his head solemnly, and with his eyes and
mouth made such a face that if the little
old man had seen it he would probably have
boxed his ears for him. This "die happy"
was silly. Death had always frightened
him whenever he had come near to it.</p>

<p>"Have you been to war?" Pinocchio
asked the little old man, half ironically.</p>

<p>"Can't you see?" and he pointed to a row
of medals pinned on his coat.</p>

<p>"And you would go back?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, if they would take me as a
volunteer."</p>

<p>This reply brought a strange longing to
Pinocchio, all the more that the tick-tock,
tick-tock, tick-tock in the box inside of his
body was making so much noise that it
rang in his ears. And then the gay notes
of the band, the joyous air of the soldiers,
the cheers of the crowd, suddenly brought
a strange idea into his head. The war, with
its cannon, marches on one side, fighting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
on the other, horses dashing, flags waving
in the wind, songs of victory, medals on the
breast, prisoners tied together like sausages,
war trophies, danced before his eyes in a
fantastic dance. The war must be just the
place for him, all the more so when he
thought that it couldn't be easy to get to
it if the little old man who had been there
so often couldn't go now.</p>

<p>"I, too, will go to the war with the soldiers,"
he said, in a low voice, and without
wasting a moment he pushed his way between
the troops, who, now that they were
approaching the station, began to close up
the ranks. He found himself by the side
of a young blond soldier, who seemed more
lonely and sad than the others.</p>

<p>"Will you take me with you?" Pinocchio
asked, pulling at his coat.</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"To the war."</p>

<p>"You? Are you crazy?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed."</p>

<p>"And you ask me to take you with
me?"</p>

<p>"Whom, then, must I ask?"</p>

<p>"There is the guard down there, that one
with a blue scarf over his shoulder."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span></p>

<p>When Pinocchio got an idea in his head
he had to work it out at any cost. So he
repeated his demand to the lieutenant of
the guard, who, smiling under his mustache,
pointed out the captain inspecting
the troops. But the captain could decide
nothing without the consent of the battalion
commander, who, for his part, would have
had to ask the approval of the colonel.
He advised Pinocchio to hasten matters by
going to the adjutant, who could present
his request directly to the general.</p>

<p>They were now in the station. The soldiers
took their places in the huge cars,
around which crowded their families,
friends, and the cheering, curious throng.
At the end of the train some first-class carriages
were attached into which the orderlies
carried the hand-baggage of their higher
officers. In front of one compartment reserved
for one of these was piled up a
regular mountain of small objects&mdash;little
packages, boxes, rugs, furs, which a cavalry
soldier was trying to carry inside. The
adjutant, a few feet away, was looking on,
trembling with impatience and vexation.</p>

<p>"Quick! Quick! You lazybones! Quick!
Quick! Mollica. General Win-the-War
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
will be here in a minute and his things are
not yet inside. I'll put you under arrest
for a fortnight."</p>

<p>"I respectfully beg the adjutant to observe
that I have only two hands for the
service of my general and of my country."</p>

<p>"And I beg you to observe that the train
is about to start off."</p>

<p>"If the adjutant would order some one
to give me a hand ..."</p>

<p>"There isn't any one to be had, confound
it!"</p>

<p>Just at that moment Pinocchio advanced
resolutely toward the adjutant to put forward
his request to be enlisted.</p>

<p>"Mr. Adjutant ... I have come ...
to ..."</p>

<p>The adjutant didn't let Pinocchio say
another word, but caught hold of him under
the chin, squeezed him, shook him gently
... and said:</p>

<p>"Good! I understand ... you want to
do something for the army.... Good boy!
You are the best kind of a volunteer. Fine!
Help Private Mollica to carry in all this
stuff and your country will be grateful to
you. And you, Mollica, hurry up. I beg
you to observe that now you have the four
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
hands you requested for the job. We understand
each other, heh?"</p>

<p>Then he was off toward a group of soldiers
who were chalking on the door of one
of the railway carriages in large letters:
"<i>Through Train&mdash;Venice&mdash;Trieste&mdash;Vienna</i>."
A big crowd had gathered around, stopping
the traffic.</p>

<p>"Ho, boys, who told you to write <i>through
train</i>? Next time ask permission from your
superior officer.... There will be a little
stop before we get there."</p>

<p>"Doesn't matter, sir, as long as we <i>get</i>
there."</p>

<p>"Well! You can tell when a train leaves,
but not whether it will ever arrive."</p>

<p>"Hurrah for Italy!"</p>

<p>"Good boys! I like that. But rub out
what you have written. You are first-class
soldiers, you are. We understand each other,
heh?" And off he went.</p>

<p>With Pinocchio's aid Private Mollica
performed miracles. In a few minutes the
general's things were inside, beautifully arranged
in the baggage-racks.</p>

<p>"You are a prodigy, boy, I tell you. You
have done me a great service and my adjutant
will be so pleased that if you will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
promise to keep guard here a moment I will
go to tell him so that he can thank you in
the general's name."</p>

<p>"Go along; I'll stay," Pinocchio replied,
and took up a position in front of the door
that was so soldierly you might have taken
him for a distant relative of Napoleon the
Great before St. Helena.</p>

<p>But a minute had not gone by and
Mollica had not got a hundred steps away
when Pinocchio turned as pale as death and
trembled so with fright that he almost fell
off the step. He had caught sight a short
way off of General Win-the-War surrounded
by a crowd of officers; and with his marvelous
vision had recognized in him Papa
Geppetto's furious tenant, whose stained
glass he had shattered a few hours before,
all on account of saucy Coccorito.</p>

<p>He was lost; there was no possible way
of escape! Win-the-War was coming direct
to his compartment and the adjutant
was guiding him. The crowd in the way
divided before him and the soldiers stood
stiffly at attention. Even Mollica stood
there straight as a ramrod.... Pinocchio
gave a leap into the compartment,
hoping to escape by the opposite door.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
But it was not possible to open it....
He heard the sound of the approaching
steps, the ring of the spurs.... Pinocchio
flung himself down on the floor of the
compartment and hid himself, face downward,
under one of the seats.</p>

<p>The general, a colonel, and the adjutant
got in. A band struck up the national air;
thousands of voices cheered the King, Italy,
and the Army. The soldiers responded
with youthful courage.... You heard
a continual medley of good-bys and good
wishes, and the quick, sharp repetition of
commands. A hundred voices were singing,
"Farewell, my dear one, farewell"; a
hundred others sang Garibaldi's Hymn....
There was a profound silence in the
compartment. Perhaps the superior officers
felt the great responsibility of the moment
and were moved by it. Pinocchio
didn't dare breathe for fear of betraying
himself, but in his breast the tick-tock,
tick-tock, tick-tock beat so loudly that
he thought it must resound all along
the wooden walls of the carriage. The
notes of the national air seemed to be
quicker ... the cries of the crowd louder
... the locomotive whistled shrilly a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
desperate good-by ... the train began to
move....</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said the general to his two
companions, "let Italy's fate now be fulfilled.
To-morrow we shall cross the frontier,
for the glory of our King and for the
greatness of our country. Long live Italy!"</p>

<p>There was so much emotion in the old
soldier's voice that Pinocchio felt as if a rope
were strangling his throat. When the train
was under way, rumbling noisily along the
rails, he burst out crying and discovered
that he had a heart just as if he were a real
boy!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="center b13"><i>How Pinocchio Recognized the Advantages
of His Wooden Body</i></p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span></p>

<p>"So, Colonel, you understand? This afternoon
we shall be at &mdash;&mdash; (censor); we
shall bivouac the troops; to-morrow morning
at two we must be on the march. We
shall cross the frontier at &mdash;&mdash; (censor) and
we shall descend toward &mdash;&mdash;. I expect
rapid and united advance until we encounter
serious opposition. Remind the soldiers of
the respect due to property in the conquered
lands and to the beaten foes taken
prisoners.... I have been told by the
commander-in-chief that it has been discovered
that there is a host of spies who
are working to injure us. I command you
to be very severe with spies caught in the
act, no matter what their age, race, or social
standing. Tell your officers to keep absolutely
secret all orders which they receive. If
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
there is the slightest suspicion that an order
relating to our advance has reached the ear
of a person suspected even in the slightest
degree, take him out, stand him with his
face to the wall, and give him eight bullets
in his back. You understand&mdash;without
fear of consequences
or that you may be
mistaken. It would
be better than to
allow&mdash;let us suppose
such a case&mdash;a
whole regiment to be
destroyed."</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/im_037.jpg" width="172" height="216" alt="The General" />
</div>

<p>Pinocchio, who
had been beginning
to enjoy the adventure, the swaying of the
train, which, as he lay on his face, tickled
his stomach, and the conversation of the
general, which greatly interested him, was
so terrified at these words that his body
felt like goose-flesh. For a moment he
thought he would faint. His ears rang
loudly and he burst into a sweat. Heigh-ho!
The general was not a man to say such
things as a joke: "If there is the slightest
suspicion that an order relating to our advance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
has reached the ear of a person suspected
even in the slightest degree, take
him out, stand him with his face to the
wall, and give him eight bullets in his back."
It was clear. As clear as it could be! Instead
of a <i>single</i> order, Pinocchio had overheard
a number ... they would certainly
take him for a spy, and most certainly the
eight bullets would not be lacking.</p>

<p>"Eight!" he exclaimed to himself as soon
as he had managed to grow a little calmer.
"Eight! One would be enough for me, and
even that would be too much! But I don't
want to die with bullets in my back....
I am not a spy at all. Well ... how can
I persuade that orang-outang that I am in
this compartment and under this seat for
no other purpose than to go to war against
my country's enemies, and because the authorities
certainly wouldn't let me go in a
more decent way? And suppose he recognizes
me as the one who smashed his stained-glass
window that opened out on his terrace,
instead of eight bullets, he will order
me a couple of dozen.... What a pity!
Poor me! Poor Papa Geppetto, what will
he say about me? But, to sum it up, I am
not a spy, and when any one wants to pretend
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
to be what he is not he must find out
the way to show them that he is not what
they believe him to be.... The best
way, I think, would be to slip off quietly.
No one saw me come in here ... all I have
to do is to get out without any one's seeing
me. It can't be very difficult to do that;
I'll just stay quietly until the train gets to
its destination, then let these gentlemen step
out, and a minute later I'll fade away."</p>

<p>If you could have poked your head under
the seat and seen Pinocchio's face at this
moment you would have been made happy
by his joyful smile. This little bit of reasoning
had so quieted his mind that if they
had pressed eight muskets against his back
to shoot the famous eight bullets into him
he would have begun to laugh as if they
were doing it only to tickle him.</p>

<p>He stretched himself out slowly, and,
lulled by the swaying of the train, was soon
overcome by such a tranquil slumber that
he couldn't have slept better in his own little
bed.</p>

<p>"Poor Pinocchio!" I think I hear you
say. "What is going to happen to him
now?" Yes, that's the way. It is the
usual rule in this world that when a person
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
thinks he can enjoy a moment of blessed
repose some misfortune is lying in wait for
him. If Pinocchio, instead of letting himself
be overcome with sleep, had kept his
eyes and ears open while the train was slowing
down and the locomotive ahead was
puffing noisily he would have heard General
Win-the-War let out a yell of pain.
Of course, he should have kept it back, but
in time of war we pardon certain things,
particularly when a general about to make
an attack suffers from the torture of rheumatic
sciatica, an old trouble of his.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, General?"</p>

<p>"My leg. My pain has come back; it's
worse than an Austrian bullet."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you have taken a little cold."</p>

<p>"Perhaps.... It doesn't seem warm
here, for a fact, does it, Colonel?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed."</p>

<p>"We are in the mountains and still climbing,
and the temperature is going down."</p>

<p>"Gracious me! so it is. They ought
... Major, do me the favor at the next
stop to ask if it is possible to heat the
compartment. If the rest of you don't like
the heat you can just go into the next
compartment."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span></p>

<p>"The idea!"</p>

<p>At the next stop, which was not long in
coming, the colonel asked permission of his
superior officer to go off for an inspection
of his men, and the major went off to see
about heat for his commanding officer. It
was not a hard matter to obtain what he
wanted. The general was traveling in an
up-to-date carriage, one of those that have
under the seats special steam coils which
can be connected with the exhaust pipes of
the locomotive's boiler, and, by a simple
adjustment, begin to send out heat immediately.</p>

<p>The signal for departure had already been
given when the major returned joyfully to
the compartment.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"The connection is made and we have
heat on."</p>

<p>"Or rather we shall have it, because just
now ..."</p>

<p>"Excuse me, General, all we have to do
is to push that handle where the sign says
'cold' and 'hot' and ..."</p>

<p>The general, who was following the maneuver
attentively, uttered an "Oh!" of relief
as if the compartment were suddenly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
transformed into a hothouse, and stretched
his legs out comfortably, resting his feet on
the opposite seat.</p>

<p>I can't tell you where Pinocchio's
thoughts were at this moment. But I can
assure you that he was dreaming and that
they must have been pleasant dreams, because
there was a beautiful smile on his face.
But suddenly the expression changed to one
strange and painful. Perhaps in his dreams,
while he was seated at a table that was
spread with the most delicious dainties, he
felt himself slipping down, down, and suddenly
found himself on a hot gridiron with
St. Lawrence in person. It is certain
that when he opened his eyes it was impossible
to breathe the air beneath the seat,
and where his back touched it, it was hot
enough to bake a loaf of bread. He started
to jump out, but caught sight, right in front
of his nose, of the little wheels in the adjutant's
spurs. The sight of these brought
him back to his real situation.</p>

<p>"But what is the matter?" he said to
himself. "Is the axle of the wheel on fire?
And can I keep from burning? But if they
notice it, too? If no one moves that means
that there is no danger ... but, Heavens!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
it burns! Ouch! I am covered with sweat,
but I have got to stand it.... If I get out
there will be the eight bullets in my back.
Poor me! How much better it would be if
I were still nothing but a wooden puppet!"</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/im_043.jpg" width="400" height="165" alt="On a Hot Gridiron"  />
</div>

<p>Well, I can't help him. It's too much for
me. It would indeed have been convenient
at that moment to be made of wood, for he
was in a situation such as no one would
wish for any creature of flesh and blood&mdash;for
me or you, for instance. He had either
to stand being steamed on the boiling pipe
of the heating apparatus or to give himself
up into the hands of the general, who
wouldn't delay long the threatened shooting.</p>

<p>Pinocchio was a hero, also a regular martyr,
because he stood the torture more than
half an hour, turning himself from side to
side, moving restlessly, and drawing up his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
body in one way and another like the aforesaid
St. Lawrence of blessed memory, the
only difference being that the saint expected
to be well cooked on one side and then to
turn over and be cooked on the other;
while Pinocchio, when he discovered that
a certain part of him was about to be cooked
in earnest, let out a loud scream and followed
it by calls for "Help! help!"</p>

<p>General Win-the-War and the adjutant
jumped to their feet like jacks-in-the-box,
threw themselves down on the ground, and,
without paying any attention to the blow
on the heads they gave each other, ran
their arms under the seat, and with outstretched
hands seized hold of Pinocchio
and dragged him out. They nearly tore
him in two like a tender chicken, one pulling
him on one side and one on the other.</p>

<p>"You wretch!"</p>

<p>"You scoundrel!"</p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>"Speak, you miserable creature!"</p>

<p>"General, he is a spy."</p>

<p>"We must question him in German ...
he must be an Austrian."</p>

<p>"<i>Wer sind Sie?</i>"</p>

<p>No answer.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span></p>

<p>"What language do you speak, you little
beast?"</p>

<p>Poor Pinocchio couldn't even draw a long
breath. The general clutched him by the
collar with such a military firmness that he
turned the color of a ripe cherry. A little
more and he would have been strangled to
death.</p>

<p>The adjutant saved him by respectfully
bidding the general remember that in questioning
a prisoner it is necessary to allow
him to breathe if you wish an answer.</p>

<p>"Mr. General ... forgive me. I am not
a spy. It would be a real crime if you
had me shot ... just as soon as we arrive
at ... Give me a gun and I will go
to war with the troops."</p>

<p>"Oh, you wretch! So you listened to all
we said?"</p>

<p>"How could I help it? I was under here
when the train started. It was I who helped
Private Mollica to put all your stuff inside."</p>

<p>"Even this leather case?"</p>

<p>"Certainly I, I myself."</p>

<p>"Even the despatch-case with the plans!
Major, give me your revolver so that I can
shoot him like a dog."</p>

<p>"But why do you want to shoot me, Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
General? I haven't done anything....
I wanted to go to the war to hear the
cannon, but I never spied on any one,
not even when I went to school.... Can
you really take me for a Boche? No, for
gracious' sake, no.... Look at my features....
No, no, no, for Heaven's sake!
Keep your weapon quiet.... Don't you
know who I am?... I am Pinocchio,
Papa Geppetto's Pinocchio ... who only
this morning broke your stained-glass window...."</p>

<p>At that point the general uttered such a
roar that Pinocchio felt his breath leave
him. But he saw the officer hand back the
pistol to the major and take up from the
seat a big leather bag; then he didn't see
the bag again, but he felt it several times
and with great force exactly on the part of
his body which had suffered the most from
the heat of the steam coil.... But Pinocchio
was saved by his sincerity. General
Win-the-War could certainly not have
bothered to beat a real spy, but I can tell
you that at that moment Pinocchio would
have preferred to be still a wooden puppet.

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="center b13"><i>How Pinocchio Sent a Solemn Protest to
Francis Joseph to Rectify an Official
Bulletin</i></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span></p>

<p>May had come with her blossoms, but
up there a sharp wind was blowing so
that it seemed still February. Pinocchio,
half naked as he was, shivered like a leaf,
and every now and then let out a sneeze
which sounded like a bursting shell. At
every sneeze Mollica gave him a kick,
Corporal Fanfara a box on the ear, and
Drummer Stecca a pinch. The only one
who didn't abuse him was Bersaglierino, the
blond young soldier, more melancholy than
his companions, whom he had first accosted
in the station when they were setting out.
I have told you that Pinocchio trembled
with cold, and I will tell you that it was
almost a good thing for him to do so; otherwise
they would have seen him tremble with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
fear. If this had happened, his teasing companions
would have driven him to despair.
Pinocchio was to be pitied. He was at the
front, the frontier several miles behind them,
and any minute might bring Austrian bullets
whistling through the air. The general
had spared the youngster from being shot
in the back, but he had given orders to put
him in the very front line during the advance
and to keep him well guarded. In
one case the guns of the enemy would do
justice to the suspected spy; in the other,
Pinocchio would clear himself by his conduct
and at the same time would lose his
desire for a close view of the enemy.</p>

<p>Private Mollica was furious with him.</p>

<p>"Che-chew! che-chew! che-chew!"</p>

<p>"Plague take you!" Another kick.
"Keep still, you little beast! If you let
the enemy spot us I'll stick this bayonet in
your backbone."</p>

<p>"I can't stand it any longer. I am
frozen&mdash;che-chew!"</p>

<p>"Stop it!" Another box on the ear.
"You are all right. You wanted to be a
volunteer; now you see how much fun it is."</p>

<p>"I?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you.... You were the cause of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
the fine talking-to my general gave me,
and you made me lose my place as an orderly
where I had a chance to make extra
soldi. If you hadn't gone and told him
that you had helped me to carry his things
and if you hadn't slipped under the seat of
that same officer to listen to what he said,
I shouldn't have been punished by being
sent to the front."</p>

<p>"Are you afraid, then, Mollica?"</p>

<p>"I afraid? But don't you know that if I
catch sight of an Austrian I'll eat him?"</p>

<p>"Like the food you took from the general,"
that rascal of a Pinocchio dared to
remark.</p>

<p>There was a chorus of laughs that stopped
as if by magic at the sound of a certain roar
in the distance and of something whistling
through the air and very near.</p>

<p>"There they are!"</p>

<p>"We're in it."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Where are they?"</p>

<p>Who paid any attention now to Pinocchio?
All of them had drawn close to one
another and had rushed to the edge of the
road, their guns pointed, to examine the distant
landscape. The mountain was very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
steep there and covered with thick vegetation.
Down at the bottom, toward the
plain, there seemed to be an unexpected
rise ... after the steep descent a green
stretch through which a river ran like a
silver ribbon. Still farther, was a chain of
low mountains, almost like a cloud on the
edge of the peaceful horizon.</p>

<p>There was the roar of some more shots
and the whistling of the shells, and a branch
of a tree was splintered and fell.</p>

<p>Pinocchio, alone in the middle of the road,
felt a creeping up and down his spine and
experienced a trembling in his legs that
shook like a palsied man's. The second
time he heard a shell whistle he felt that
he must find a hole in which to hide himself.
He looked about him and caught
sight near by of an enormous larch-tree
which pointed directly toward the heavens.
I don't know how to explain it, but the
sight of it took away from Pinocchio the
desire to hide himself under the ground and
made him wish to climb toward the stars.
He gave a spring and shinned up the big
trunk in a flash. I bet you a plugged
soldo against a lira that you would have
done the same....

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">"I SEE THE SUET-EATERS"</p>
</div></div>

<p>"I see them! I see them!"</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Whom do you see?"</p>

<p>"Where are they? Where are you that
we can't see you?"</p>

<p>"I am up here."</p>

<p>"Bravo! And whom do you see?" Bersaglierino
asked.</p>

<p>"I see the suet-eaters."</p>

<p>"Where are they?"</p>

<p>"Down there where there is a kind of
slope there is a town hidden among the
trees ... up here you can see a roof and
the spire of a bell-tower ... you can see
people on the roof ... you can see something
glisten ... now they are firing."</p>

<p>This time there were several reports, but
they seemed to be aiming in another direction,
because there was not the usual whistle
in the air.</p>

<p>"Whom are they 'strafing'?" Corporal
Fanfara asked himself.</p>

<p>"I'll 'strafe' that scoundrel Pinocchio.
If you don't come down alive I will bring
you down dead with a bullet in the seat of
your trousers."</p>

<p>"But listen! Look down there and see
whom they're giving it to," cried the enraged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
Bersaglierino, pointing out a marching
column which was hurrying below them.</p>

<p>"Our infantry!"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed. They will beat us to it.
It's a shame."</p>

<p>"Our company ought to start off at a
double-quick."</p>

<p>"It must be a half-mile away."</p>

<p>"But the bersaglieri must get there first ...
even if there are only the four of us."</p>

<p>"Sure thing."</p>

<p>"Do you hear?"</p>

<p>"Forward, Savoy!"</p>

<p>And, heads lowered and bayonets fixed,
they rushed down the slope.</p>

<p class="p2">"Ho! boys! Ho! Mol-li-ca! Cor-po-ral!...
Oh! They are going off without me!
What a mean thing to do! They leave me
here at the top of this tree and run off....
But if they think they can play me such a
trick they are mistaken.... I am hungry
as a wolf, and if I don't get them to feed
me, whom can I join? Run, run....
We'll see who gets there first!"</p>

<p>He climbed down the tree, grumbling as
he went, tightened the belt of his trousers,
drank in several deep breaths of air, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
then tore off like an express train behind
time.</p>

<p>I will tell you at once, not to keep you
in suspense, that the bersaglieri got there
the first, the infantry second, and Pinocchio
... a good third. I call it a "good
third" merely as a way of expressing it, because
when he arrived at the village our
soldiers had already passed through it and
had advanced some distance beyond, following
the Austrians, who had taken to their
heels and who were suffering a sharp fire at
short range.</p>

<p>The village was so small that it didn't
even deserve the name of one. There were
ten houses in all besides the church with the
bell-tower, and a long shed over which
waved the white flag with the red cross.
There was a deathlike silence everywhere.
On the little square before the church some
bodies of Austrian soldiers were lying;
among them was that of an officer so ugly
that he seemed to have died of fright, but
there was a red spot on his back. Pinocchio
was terrified at the sight of him, but
he had such a longing for his sword, his
automatic pistol, his handsome belt, his
light-blue cape, and his cap that he persuaded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
himself it was perfectly silly to be
afraid of a dead Austrian, particularly when
they weren't afraid of live ones. Without
too much reflection,
he buckled on the
dead man's belt,
armed himself with
the pistol, wrapped
himself in the blue
cape, and pressed
the cap down on his
head. He was good
to look at, I can assure
you.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/im_056.jpg" width="234" height="367" alt="New Disguise" />
</div>
<p>The Hapsburg
army had never had
an officer who could
be compared
with this
puppet who
had now become
a real
boy. Pinocchio
was
prancing up and down in his new disguise,
his sword clanking against the pavement,
just like any little lieutenant, when
he heard a horrible roar high up overhead,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
then, a moment later, an explosion
which shook the ground! When he lifted
up his head to see what had happened he
thought he caught sight of some one walking
about on the church's bell-tower. He saw
a rag tied to a pole waving and, as if in reply
to a signal, brumm! another shot that fell
closer. Pinocchio, who was suspicious, went
into the vestry and, pistol in hand, rushed
up the steep little wooden stairs. He got
to the top without even making the old
worm-eaten stairs squeak. In the space
where the bells hung a man in civilian's
clothes had his back turned toward him.
He was looking off from the balcony, and
kept on waving the red cloth. You could
see the vast expanse of the plain, and
among the green a strange, intermittent
flash ... then a puff ... then you heard
a roar, followed by a crash, like a moving
train rapidly approaching, then a tremendous
explosion. The shells never fell as
far as the town, but burst all around it,
sending up columns of earth and smoke.
And off there Pinocchio could see the bersaglieri,
the soldiers of his country. The
traitor with his signals was directing fire
on the Italian troops.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span></p>

<p>Tell me truly, what would you have done
if you had been in Pinocchio's place?
Would you have fired at the traitor? Yes
or no. Well, Pinocchio did the same&mdash;cocked
his pistol, shut his eyes, pulled the
trigger, and pum-pum-pum-pum-pum-pum-pum,
seven shots went off. He had expected
only one, and was so frightened
that he pitched his weapon away and took
to his heels, down the steps, without thought
of the wretch, who, for his part, did no more
signaling, I assure you!</p>

<p>When he had got down to the square
Pinocchio rushed across it, and was about
to run in the direction where he had seen
his bersaglieri fighting, when, passing by the
shed where the Red Cross flag waved, he
thought he heard the sound of several
voices in a lively discussion. He stopped
suddenly and very, very quietly approached
a big window closed merely by a wire
netting. Inside he saw on one side of the
large room two rows of beds, in the middle
a group of rough-looking soldiers, with
waxed mustaches, completely armed, who
were busy plotting together. Just at that
moment they separated to go to bed. They
took off their weapons, hid them under the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
sheets, and slipped themselves into bed,
drawing the covers up to their noses.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="rag" id="rag"></a>

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">HE SAW A RAG TIED TO A POLE WAVING</p>
</div></div>

<p>"<i>Wunderschön!</i>" ("Fine.")</p>

<p>"When Italian pigs come we make a colossal
festival," grunted a Croat and laughed
boisterously. "We sick get well, and Italians
all croak."</p>

<p>"I'll croak you," muttered Pinocchio,
who in a twinkle had understood the deviltry
the wretches were planning. He made
himself as small as he could, so that the
cape dragged on the ground like a petticoat,
slunk along the walls of the shed, then
rushed off at full speed toward the fields.
He was just passing the last house of the
village when he found himself unexpectedly
surrounded by a score of Austrian soldiers
in a half-tipsy condition, so that they took
him for their superior officer. He thought
himself lost.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant, don't go farther. 'Talians
still near and make croak all Croats."</p>

<p>"Croat? I a Croat!"</p>

<p>"'Talians make croak Slovaks, too."</p>

<p>"Oh! Mamma!"</p>

<p>"<i>Ja, ja!</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>Ja, ja!</i>"</p>

<p>Pinocchio had a flash of intuition; he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
hid his hand under his cape, unsheathed
the sword, and, assuming so martial a manner
that then and there he could have been
taken for a handsome brother of William,
he yelled and swore some doggerel which
the dolts might think was Hungarian, Dalmatian,
or Rumanian, spun 'round and continued
on his way to the Italian position.
The Austrians followed him, bayonets fixed,
convinced that the spirit of Tegetoff had
come to life and was leading them to victory.
But instead, when they had gone a hundred
yards they were showered with bullets and
had to fling themselves on the ground in
order to escape immediate extermination.
Pinocchio saw that he was being shot at
more than the others, and didn't know
why. All around him the torn-up earth
was strewn with plumes.</p>

<p>"I should like to know why they are after
me especially, who am not even firing, while
they are sparing these monkeys who have
followed me and are shooting like mad.
Oh! Perhaps it is on account of the uniform
of that miserable officer. If that is
the case, my dear ones, enough of your
sport. 'Oho! I am an Italian. Stop
firing, for Heaven's sake, so that I can tell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
you something important. Oho! Enough,
I say!'"</p>

<p>And standing up straight, he hurled the
cape and the cap away from him, and with
no thought of danger, made for the spot
from which came the Italian fire.</p>

<p>Then came the end of the scene. The
Croats behind him jumped to their feet like
so many jacks-in-the-box, threw their arms
about and waved their hands in the air....
From a hedge not far off, a company
of bersaglieri came running up and surrounded
them, yelling, "Surrender!"</p>

<p>"If one of them moves, stick him like a
toad," commanded a lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Don't worry, sir, I'll spit him for your
roasting."</p>

<p>"Secure their officer."</p>

<p>"Heh, boys! don't joke ... lower your
bayonets. I'm no Austrian officer. I am
Pinocchio. Mollica, don't you recognize
me?"</p>

<p>"You beastly little creature, what game
are you playing? But I'll run you through,
all the same."</p>

<p>"What's up now?"</p>

<p>"Lieutenant, Mollica wants to make believe
that I am an Austrian lieutenant, because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
I was the cause of his losing his place
as orderly with General Win-the-War, but I
am Pinocchio. Do you know me? I am
glad. Order these twenty apes, which I
have brought all the way here, to be
bound, and then if you give me thirty men
I will guarantee to catch some others that
I have put to bed in the big barracks under
the protection of the Red Cross, who pretended
they were ill, but who had hidden
their guns under the covers to 'croak
Italian hogs.'"</p>

<p>"Where are they?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you now ... then I'll show you
up on the tower what a pretty thing I found&mdash;a
traitor who was making signals to some one
far off, and then, boom! there came one of
those shells that burst. I meant to let him
have one little bullet, but the pistol fired
so many at him that I threw everything
away...."</p>

<p>"But come on! Come on! Show me
the way!"</p>

<p>"Right away, but on one condition&mdash;that
when I have guided you, you will
give me something to eat, because I am
so hungry that I could eat that miserable
Mollica."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span></p>

<p>"Come on, boy, to the village. Double
quick!"</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="beastly" id="beastly"></a>
<img src="images/im_065.jpg" width="364" height="550" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">"YOU BEASTLY LITTLE CREATURE, WHAT GAME ARE YOU
PLAYING?"</p>
</div></div>

<p class="p2">Who would have imagined that his regiment
had been fighting continuously for ten
hours, leaving some dead on the field and
sending not a few wounded to the ambulance?
There on the square of the village
won by Italy, beneath the shadow of the
red, white, and green flag that waved from
the summit of the little tower, the brave
boys gave vent to unrestrained joy. It was
time for rations. In the camp kitchens big
pots were steaming, but the soldiers did not
crowd around them as usual to fill their
canteens. The bersaglieri's attention was
held by a sight which put them in good
humor, and good humor in war is a rare
thing. Pinocchio was eating! He had
swallowed three platefuls of soup in five
minutes, and as he continued to grunt that
he was hungry, they had given him a canteen
full to the top and slipped into it a
piece of meat that would have been sufficient
to satisfy the hunger of four city
employees.</p>

<p>"Look out for bones!"</p>

<p>"Are you going to eat them all?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span></p>

<p>"If he stays with us he'll break the
Government."</p>

<p>"Look out, boys, he'll end by bursting."</p>

<p>"Don't you split open with all the Austrians
you have eaten, for pork is more
indigestible than asses' meat."</p>

<p>"Heh! don't find fault with the food."</p>

<p>"And what kind of meat do you call this?"</p>

<p>"The best beef."</p>

<p>"Lie! I am familiar with animals ...
you give beef to the officers; donkey-meat
to the soldiers."</p>

<p>"Look out, you Pinocchio, you'll get into
trouble with that tongue of yours."</p>

<p>"Then let me eat in peace. You are all
staring at me as if I were a Zulu chewing a
hen with her feathers on. My tongue can't
be dainty both talking and eating."</p>

<p>"Let's murder him."</p>

<p>And then there was a loud burst of
laughter from all. Pinocchio was shoveling
food into his mouth with both his hands,
so that his face was red as a cock's comb
and he could scarcely breathe.</p>

<p>They were already as fond of him as if
he were their son. His achievements had
won for him a certain respect even from
the officers whom he amused with his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
monkeyshines. It had been decided to
adopt Pinocchio as the "son of the regiment"
and to keep him at the front as a
mascot. He was to live with the troops and
to wear the uniform of a Boy Scout. The
soldiers with common accord had put off
his costume to an opportune moment. Do
you want to know the reason? The brave
boys were afraid to stick Pinocchio into
puttees with so many spiral bands because
his little thin legs would have frightened people.
For the time being they had him put
on a pair of short trousers which dragged
behind him on the ground, a little cape
like a bersagliere's, and a fez with a light-blue
tassel so long that it touched his heels.
This tassel was Pinocchio's delight, who, in
order to look at it, always walked along with
his head over his shoulder, and so would
keep bumping into first one thing and then
another. One day the mischievous Mollica
made him run into one of the quarter-master-corps
mules, and Pinocchio saluted
and asked its pardon. But when he ran into
officers, sergeants, corporals, and soldiers,
instead of saluting he swore at them all.</p>

<p>It is three days later. General Win-the-War's
troops have not advanced. Our bersaglieri
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
are still in camp near &mdash;&mdash;. It is
a sultry, thundering afternoon. Many of
the soldiers are sleeping. The Bersaglierino
is playing cards with Mollica. Corporal
Fanfara is shaving. Stecca is practising on
his cornet, trying a variation on a well-known
tune. Pinocchio, in the back of the
tent, is snoring so loudly that Mollica every
now and then hurls a handful of earth at his
nose to make him lower his note.</p>

<p>Suddenly the boredom is broken, every
one jumps up and runs out to a certain
point and crowds around an automobile
that has just arrived. Pinocchio wakes up
with a start, finds his mouth full of grit, his
nose dirty, and hears all the noise about
him&mdash;has a terrible fright, lets out a yell,
and rushes out of the tent. But he is
scarcely outside before he feels himself
caught up by his legs and whirled around
on the ground. He gets up again and is
face to face with Bersaglierino, who has
not left his post and who laughs loudly at
Pinocchio's plight.</p>

<p>"What has happened?"</p>

<p>"The mail has come."</p>

<p>"And you're making all this racket for
that? I thought it was the Austrians."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span></p>

<p>"You little coward, you!"</p>

<p>"That's enough, Bersaglierino, if you say
that to me again I'll give you such a kick
that will change your shape. But why
don't you,
too, go to see
if you have
any letters?"</p>

<div class="figright" >
<img src="images/im_071.jpg" width="227" height="270" alt="Bersaglierino" />
</div>

<p>"Who do
you think
would write
me? I am as
alone in the
world as a dog,
just like you,
it seems."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's
so," replied
Pinocchio,
swallowing
hard, because he had suddenly felt his
throat tighten at the thought of Papa
Geppetto, from whom he had had no news
for many a long day.</p>

<p>"It is a red-letter day for the others.
Mollica will have a letter from his father,
Fanfara news from his two babies, Stecca
kisses from his wife.... I might be killed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
to-morrow by a bullet in the stomach and
they would let me rot in a ditch and that
would be the end."</p>

<p>Mollica came back, his arms full of newspapers.
His father, a news-dealer in Naples,
sent him a copy of every unsold publication,
knowing that anything may come in
useful in war-times, even old news.</p>

<p>"Heh! Bersaglierino! You want us to
play the postman and yet you don't take
any trouble to get your scented letter."</p>

<p>"You are joking?"</p>

<p>"No, it's no joke. Here is one really for
you, and I congratulate you because if you
are engaged she must be at least a countess."</p>

<p>The Bersaglierino took the letter his comrade
held out to him and read the address
over several times. There was no doubt; it
was his name that was written on the scented
envelope the color of a blush rose. He
turned pale and stood for a moment undecided,
then he tore it open and read:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Bersaglierino</span>,&mdash;I saw how sad and alone
you were at the moment of your departure, so I felt
it was my duty as a patriotic Italian girl to write
to you. Go and fight for our country; do your duty
bravely, and remember that in thought I follow and
will follow you every minute. If you return valorously
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
I will meet you and tell you how happy I am;
if you fall wounded I will go to your hospital bed
to soothe your suffering; if you die for your country
my flowers shall lie on your grave and your name
will always be written in my heart. Long live Italy!</p>

<p class="left45">Your war-godmother,<br />
<span class="smcap i10">Fatina.</span></p>
</div>
<p>"Long live Italy!" Bersaglierino shouted
like mad. He caught up his hat with its
cock plumes and tossed it in the air with
all his force, seized Pinocchio who was standing
by him, and lifted him up in both his
arms, pulled his cap off his head, and then
twirled it round on his pate, scratching the
poor boy's nose.</p>

<p>"What's got into you? Are you crazy?"</p>

<p>"Am I crazy? I am happy! I am not
alone any more, do you understand? I am
no longer an unlucky fellow like you with
no one belonging to him. But I am fonder
of you than ever. Give me a kiss ..."
and he pressed such a hearty kiss on his
nose that his comrades laughed. But Pinocchio
longed to cry. The heart in his
body beat a violent tick-tock, tick-tock.</p>

<p>"Have you read what Franz Joe's newspapers
say?&mdash;'Italian soldiers are brigands
who do not respect civilians or the wounded
in the hospitals.' That means you, dear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
Pinocchio, because you shot the traitor on
the tower. You can be sure that if the
suet-eaters win they will make you pay for
the crime."</p>

<p>"Me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, you! You don't intend to
say that I killed him, do you? And you,
thank God, are not an enlisted Italian soldier,
therefore ..."</p>

<p>"I understand."</p>

<p>The camp was quiet once again; indeed, I
might say that tender memories had softened
its youthful exuberance. The voices
from home were keeping the soldiers silent.
It was as if every letter their eyes fell on
was speaking to them quietly and they were
blessed in listening, their faces shining with
happiness. Corporal Fanfara held a sheet
of paper on which there was nothing but
some strange scrawls. He gazed at it with
delight, and while two big tears ran down
his cheeks he murmured in his Venetian
dialect, "My darling little rascals!" These
scrawls of theirs were more welcome to him
than the letter from his wife which told of
privations, anxiety, and troubles. Private
Mollica was acting like a detective, searching
through the newspaper pages for his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
father's dirty finger-marks; and as there
was little trouble in finding them he kept
repeating every moment, "This was made
by my dear old man." Then he kissed the
marks so often that his whole mouth was
black with printer's ink.</p>

<p>Shortly after every one was writing,
some bent over their writing-tablets, some
on the back of a good-natured comrade,
some stretched out on the ground, some on
the edge of a bench, on the staves of a barrel,
on a tree-trunk, with pencils, fountain-pens,
on post-cards, envelopes, letter-paper
spilled out miraculously from portfolios,
bags, and canteens. Every one was writing.
The Bersaglierino seemed to be composing
a poem. He gesticulated, whacked
himself on the ear, beat time with his pen
that squirted ink in every direction, and
every now and then declaimed under his
breath certain phrases that were so moving
that they made even him weep.</p>

<p>Pinocchio was as silent and gloomy as
the hood of a dirty kitchen stove. Squatting
at the entrance to the tent, he kept
glancing at his companions, and every now
and then he would scratch his head so vigorously
that he might have been currycombing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
a donkey. When Pinocchio scratched
his head in that way ... Well, now you
know that matters were serious, but I tell
you they were so serious that he had the
courage to interrupt the Bersaglierino in his
literary studies.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, but will you do me a
favor?"</p>

<p>"What do you want? Keep quiet ...
leave me alone ... you make me lose my
thread of thought ..."</p>

<p>"So you write with thread, do you?
Are you aware that they don't use this
any more?"</p>

<p>"Stop your nonsense. Leave me alone,
puppet."</p>

<p>"Do me a favor and then ..."</p>

<p>"What is it? Spit it out!"</p>

<p>"Lend me a pencil and a piece of paper."</p>

<p>"You want to write, too?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then you, too, have some one in the
world who interests you?"</p>

<p>"Yes ... perhaps."</p>

<p>"A godmother like mine?"</p>

<p>"Hum! No indeed."</p>

<p>"You are serious about wanting to
write?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Here's paper and pencil, then. Do you
know how to write?"</p>

<p>"Once I knew how."</p>

<p>"All right. Then let me see it."</p>

<p>"Gladly."</p>

<p>Pinocchio rested his elbows on his knees,
chin on his clasped hands, and, biting his
pencil, lost himself in profound meditation.</p>

<p class="p2">"Excuse me, Bersaglierino."</p>

<p>"Ho! Finished already?"</p>

<p>"No ... that is ... yes, I have finished
beginning, but ... I don't know
what you put before the beginning."</p>

<p>"Write, 'Dear So-and-so,' or 'My darling,
etc., etc.'"</p>

<p>"But you see I can't put either 'dear' or
'my darling.'"</p>

<p>"So you are writing to a creditor?"</p>

<p>"Something like that."</p>

<p>"Heavens! Put his first name, his last
name, swear at him, and that's enough."</p>

<p class="p2">"Excuse me, Bersaglierino..."</p>

<p>"Oh, are you still there?"</p>

<p>"Yes.... I haven't been able to start
the beginning because ..."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you or do you not know how to
write?"</p>

<p>"Like a lawyer."</p>

<p>"Then?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what his last name is."</p>

<p>"Whose?"</p>

<p>"Franz Joe's."</p>

<p>"Writing to him? You want to write to
him? To that miserable Hapsburg?"</p>

<p>The news spread like lightning through
the camp. The soldiers passed it from
mouth to mouth, laughing like mad: Pinocchio
was writing to Emperor Franz Joseph!
This was interesting. They must
know what the letter said. It would certainly
be something to amuse them. So
walking quietly, as if they were all eager
to take him in the very act, they approached
the tent where Pinocchio was composing his
missive, not without difficulty. He had not
been writing for several minutes and the
words seemed so long to put down on paper.
He had to keep thinking of the spelling, and
the verbs bothered him terribly. When he
raised his head to draw a breath of relief
before re-reading what he had managed to
write, he found himself surrounded by all
the regiment.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, you are well brought up, aren't
you? Who taught you to stick your noses
into other people's business?"</p>

<p>"To whom have you written?"</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/im_079.jpg" width="400" height="367" alt="Scribbling" />
</div>

<p>"To the one I wanted to."</p>

<p>"Let's see the scribbling."</p>

<p>"Look in your mirror and you will see
worse lines on your own face."</p>

<p>"We want to read the letter."</p>

<p>"But if you are a pack of illiterates ..."</p>

<p>"Listen, either you will let me see it or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
I will take you by one ear and the letter
with the other hand, and I'll carry you both
off to the censor, who will haul you before
a court martial that will condemn you to be
shot in the back."</p>

<p>"Oh, do you really want to see it, Mollica?"</p>

<p>"You heard what I said."</p>

<p>"On one condition."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"That you will take charge of it and see
that it gets to its address."</p>

<p>"All right. Hand it here, you puppy.
Listen to what he writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"<span class="smcap">Mr. Franz Hapsburg</span>,</p>
<p>In his house in Austria,</p>

<p>"You wrote in the papers that the Italian soldiers
are rascals because they kill civilians and wounded
Ostrians. I want you to know that you are mistaken,
because as you know the traitor was killed by a pistol
that shot off Ostrian bullets by itself while it was in
my hands who am not in the army. That's how our
soldiers found the traitor already dead, the traitor who
made signals from the church tower, so that the shells
fell on the ruins. As for the wounded in the horspital
I can asshure you that they were better off than me
and you, and that they had guns between their leggs
under the sheets. He who tells lies goes to hell and
you will certainly go there, but just now I'd like to
send you there myself who don't give a hang for you.</p>

<p class="left65">"<span class="smcap">Pinocchio.</span>"</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span></p>

<p>I can't describe to you what took place
after the letter had been read.</p>

<p>They gave the poor youngster such a
feast that they had to put him to bed in
a hammock. Before Private Mollica went
to sleep he kept repeating: "I have promised
to take your letter to Franz Joseph....
You see if I don't send it through
all the ranks till it reaches his own hands.
On Mollica's honor!... I have promised
to take your letter to Franz Joseph!"
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="center b13"><i>How Pinocchio Learned That War Changes
Everything&mdash;Even the Meaning of Words</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span></p>
<p>The bersaglieri had passed the Isonzo
and were intrenched at &mdash;&mdash; (censor).
You certainly know now what the Isonzo is,
because war teaches geography better than
do teachers in the schools; so I don't intend
to explain it to you. Pinocchio had
followed his friends, and I assure you no
one regretted his coming. When there were
orders to carry to the rear or purchases to
be made, it was Pinocchio who attended to
them. Slender as a lizard and quick as a
squirrel, he was out of the trenches without
being seen and slipped along the furrows
and ditches and the bushes with marvelous
dexterity. He had been absolutely forbidden
to approach the loopholes, and when
they caught him about to disobey he got
such boxes on the ears that he had to rub
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
them for half an hour afterward. Mollica,
and the Bersaglierino in particular, kept
their eyes on him, so that they punished
him often.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="pig" id="pig"></a>
<img src="images/im_082.jpg" width="400" height="243" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p class="center">ONE DAY HE MANAGED TO CAPTURE A PIG AND TO DRAG IT ALONG BEHIND HIM</p>
</div></div>

<p>"I'd like to know why it is you two can
stand with your noses against the hole and
I mayn't."</p>

<p>"Because of the <i>mosquitoes</i>."</p>

<p>"Who cares for them? I haven't the
slightest fear of mosquitoes."</p>

<p>But when he saw them carry off a poor
soldier hit in the middle of the forehead and
understood that the "mosquitoes" were
Austrian bullets, he gained a little wisdom.
While the soldiers were suffering from the
trench life which restrained their ardent
natures, keeping them still and watchful,
the rogue of a Pinocchio amused himself
with all kinds of jokes. Dirty as he could
be, he was always grubbing with his nails
in the ground to deepen the trench, to make
some new breastwork, to build up an escarp.
If they sent him out to find logs of wood
to repair the roofs of the dugouts he would
come back laden with all sorts of things.
Hens and eggs were his favorite booty.
One day he managed to capture a pig and
to drag it along behind him. But when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
they got near the trenches the cussed animal
began to squeal so horribly that the Austrians
opened up a terrific fire on him.
For fear of the "mosquitoes" Pinocchio had
to let him go, and the pig ran to take refuge
among his brothers, the enemy.</p>

<p>That evening it rained cats and dogs.
The trench was one slimy pool. The rain
dripped everywhere, penetrating, baring the
parapets which collapsed, squirting mud
and gluing the feet of the soldiers, who, wet
to the bone, had to scurry through the wire
to carry ammunition to safety and to repair
the damage done to the trench. Pinocchio,
barelegged, ran back and forth, bemired
up to his hair, to give a helping hand
to his friends.</p>

<p>"What fun! We seem to be turning into
crabs."</p>

<p>"You are a beastly little puppy!"</p>

<p>"Poor Mollica! You really make me
sorry for you."</p>

<p>"I make you sorry for me?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. I shouldn't want to be you
in all this downpour."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because this rain will melt your sugary
nature."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span></p>

<p>Mollica, to convince him of the contrary,
started to administer one of his usual boxes
on the ear, but he slipped and fell, face
down, into the mud.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/im_086.jpg" width="372" height="394" alt="A Downpour" />
</div>

<p>"Are you comfortable, Private Mollica?
Tell me were you ever in a softer bed than
now?... You look to me like a roll
dipped in chocolate.... Bersaglierino,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
come and see how ugly he is! All chalky
up into his hair.... I never saw any one
look such an idiot!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/im_087.jpg" width="350" height="313" alt="Private Mollica" />
</div>

<p>"I wish they would murder you, you
beastly little puppy!"</p>

<p>After struggling about in the mud he
managed to get to his feet again and had
almost caught him, but in one spring Pinocchio
was far away. The telephone dugout
was a little deeper than the trench and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
water was rapidly filling it up. It was already
up to the operator's knees. A crowd
of soldiers were working hard to stop the
flood.</p>

<p>"What are you doing, stupids? Do you
think you can bail out this puddle with a
cap? You are green. We ought to have
big Bertha...."</p>

<p>He didn't get in another word. They
took hold of him by his arms and legs and
soused him into the dirty water and held
him under till he had drunk a cupful. The
telephone operator would have liked to see
him dead, then and there.</p>

<p>"Hold him under till he is as swollen as
a toad. He was calling down misfortune
on us, wishing that a shell would fall on us.
As if this rain weren't enough (che-chew,
che-chew!); we are chilled to the marrow
(che-chew!) and are likely to die bravely of
cold ... (che-chew!)."</p>

<p>"Enough! Let me go! Help! Bersaglierino!
Mollica-a-a!"</p>

<p>"What are you doing to him? Let him
go. Shame on you!" yelled Bersaglierino,
running up.</p>

<p>"But don't you know that he was wishing
a shell would hit us, the little wretch?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span></p>

<p>"Just as if we hadn't enough troubles
now."</p>

<p>"Of course you have enough, and one of
your troubles is that you are regular
beasts," cried Pinocchio as soon as he could
get his breath. "I said I wished for Bertha,
the cook in Papa Geppetto's house, to
sweep away the water in here, but now I
wish I had a broom in my hand to break
its handle against your ribs."</p>

<p>"But don't you know that a 'Big Bertha'
is a Boche gun that would have blown us
into a thousand pieces?"</p>

<p>"So, little devil, do you understand? And
now that you have learned your lesson, be
off with you."</p>

<p>There was nothing else for poor Pinocchio
to do but to spit out the mud still in his
mouth and turn on his heel.</p>

<p>"Bersaglierino, I would have believed
anything but that words change their
meaning in this way. With these idiots
you have to pay attention to what you say.
They made me swallow so much ditch-water
that it will be a miracle if I don't
have little fish swimming around in my
stomach."</p>

<p>It stopped raining, but as if the Austrians
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
didn't want to give the bersaglieri
time to repair the damages caused by the
bad weather, they began a furious bombardment
of the trench. The "mosquitoes"
kept up a terrible singing. Huge
projectiles churned up the ground all around,
digging out deep holes, raising whirls of
earth, throwing off shreds of stone and
steel in every direction. One shell had
fallen near the telephone and had done great
damage. The soldiers couldn't venture any
distance from the dugout to aim at the
enemy who was firing at them with such accuracy.
Mud prevented their movements.
They couldn't change their positions because
the slippery earth offered no foothold.
It was impossible to excavate deep because
the earth slid down. It was a critical
moment. Several men had been killed,
the wounded were moaning bitterly, the
dying were groaning.... But the Italian
bersaglieri did not lose courage and stood
up against the foe, showing a genuine disregard
for their lives. Pinocchio longed to
cry. He wasn't thinking of the danger to
himself, but of the fact that if this devilish
fire kept up much longer all his bersaglieri
would be killed. Wasn't there anybody to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
look out for them? What was our artillery
doing? Did they really intend to let them
all be massacred?</p>

<p>He had scarcely thought this when he
heard behind him the thunder of Italian
guns. A quarter of an hour later and the
Austrians were quite quiet. But the situation
hadn't improved. Orders had come
from the second line to hold out at all costs
because it wouldn't be possible to relieve
them until the next evening. An attack in
force was expected every minute.</p>

<p>The captain assembled his company and
said: "Men, we must stick and be ready
for anything. We can't have reinforcements,
but to-night they will send us <i>chevaux
de frise</i> and barbed wire. But I don't
want to be caught like a bird in a net. We
have plenty of 'jelly.' If two would volunteer
to carry a couple of pounds of it
under the entanglements of those gentlemen
over yonder we might be able to change
our lodgings. They have a fine trench of
reinforced concrete with rooms and good
beds and bathroom. We'd be better off
there than in this mud. What do you
say, boys? Is there any one who ..."</p>

<p>They didn't even let him finish. All
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
stepped forward, and, if I am to tell you
the truth, Pinocchio, too, but no one noticed
him. Mollica and the Bersaglierino
were chosen.</p>

<p>It grew dark. Some of them, completely
worn out, dozed leaning up against the side
of the trench. The Bersaglierino was writing
rapidly a letter in pencil. Mollica had
pulled out of his knapsack the old newspapers
his father had sent him and seemed
about to take up his old studies of fingerprints.
There were tears in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Heh! Mollica, you look as if you
weren't pleased with the duty the captain
has given you."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"But you ought to let me go."</p>

<p>"You? But how do you suppose they
would let a boy like you carry jelly?"</p>

<p>"Do you think I would eat it all up?
I won't say that I mightn't taste it, especially
if it is that golden-yellow kind that
shivers like a paralytic old man, but I
would carry out the order like any one
else.... Only, I can't understand how for
a little bit of jelly those scoundrels will give
up their comfortable trench. It's true that
they eat all sorts of miserable kinds of food
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
and that Esau sold his birthright for a mess
of pottage, but ..."</p>

<p>"Shut up, you chatterbox! You'll see
what will happen. I'll explain to you that
'jelly' in war-time is what we call a mixture
of stuff that when put in a pipe under the
wire entanglements and set off by a fuse will
blow you up sky-high in a thousand pieces,
if you don't take to your heels in time."</p>

<p>"And you ... want to go and be blown
up?"</p>

<p>"No. I hope to come back safe and
sound, and I have still to send your letter
to Franz Joey."</p>

<p>Pinocchio was silent and hid himself in a
corner without another word. I can't tell
you exactly if he had some sad presentiment
or if his disillusion resulting from
Mollica's technical explanation of "jelly"
had put him in a bad humor. There was
no doubt about it&mdash;war had changed the
dictionary. He was still more certain of
this when, an hour later, he saw the "Frisian
horses" arrive. He was expecting beasts
with at least four legs, and instead he saw
them drag in front of the trenches a huge
roll of iron wound up in an enormous skein
of barbed wire. But there was still a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
greater surprise in store for him. That
very night he was to find out that in war-time
not only the value of words changes,
but that there are some which are canceled
from certain persons' vocabulary.</p>

<p>It was night ... and there was nothing
to be seen and you couldn't even hear the
traditional fly. From the Austrian trench
there came a dull regular noise. It seemed
as if a lot of pigs were squealing. Instead,
it was the Croats who were snoring. No
one slept in the Italian trenches. There
was a strange coming and going, a fantastic
flittering of shadows. There was low
talking, commands were passed from mouth
to mouth and whispered in the ear&mdash;every
one was making preparations. Mollica and
the Bersaglierino had put steel helmets on
their heads and had shields of the same
metal on their arms.</p>

<p>"But what are you going to do? You
look like the statue of Perseus in the costume
of a soldier."</p>

<p>"I would almost rather be in his place
and with no more clothes than he has on
instead of in this get-up ... but what's
there to be done about it? I promised you
to take the letter to Franz Joey."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span></p>

<p>A little later Mollica and Bersaglierino
left the trench and wriggled along the
ground like serpents, carrying with them
big metal boxes. The bersaglieri took their
places behind the loopholes, their muskets
in position, and stood there motionless, anxious,
and restless. Pinocchio, too, wanted
to see what was happening, and, taking
advantage of his guardians' carelessness,
slipped out of the trench and squatted
down in a big hole which an enemy projectile
had hollowed out twenty yards away.</p>

<p>The poor youngster was very sad. The
black night, the silence everywhere, the
preparations he had watched and could not
understand, were the causes of his melancholy.</p>

<p>"But how under the sun did it ever enter
Bersaglierino's head to offer himself for
this expedition?" he thought. "He might
have let some one else go. Not so bad for
Mollica. He'll eat up the Austrians like
waffles. If any one dares to play a trick
on him he'll land him a few good blows and
put him where he belongs, but Bersaglierino
... so little and so frail.... If any misfortune
happens to him ..."</p>

<p>Some time went by, I can't say how long,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
but it was quite a little while, because Pinocchio
had almost fallen asleep, when the
air was shaken by two tremendous explosions.
He woke with a start, saw two red
flashes shining for an instant on a shower of
fragments thrown up to a great height ...
then blackness and the fiendish rattling of
the machine-guns and crackle of musket
fire. Suddenly a long white shaft of light
broke the darkness, coming from no one
knew where, waving to the right and to the
left, and fixing itself on the ground between
the two trenches, which were immediately
showered by shells.</p>

<p>"And Bersaglierino? And Mollica?" Pinocchio
asked himself, anxiously, feeling his
throat tighten up.</p>

<p>Suddenly a black shadow was outlined in
the gleam of a searchlight that was operated
from a distance. It crawled along the
ground, moving by starts. They had seen
it, too, from the trenches and there were
confused cries of, "Come on!" ...
"Bravo!" ... "A few more steps!" ...
"Stick to it!"</p>

<p>And the figure seemed to gain new
strength and to bound like a wild beast.
But who was it? Surely the Bersaglierino.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
The form was small, slender, and very
quick. Mollica was large and slow. What
had become of him? Between the roar of
the explosions and the whistle of the shells
there came a shrill cry of anguish. The
little shadow slid along, then a leap in the
silvery ray, and it was lost in the blackness
of the earth torn by the rain of steel.</p>

<p>"Oh, beasts that they are! They
have murdered him!" Pinocchio screamed.
"Enough! Enough! Wretches! Don't you
see that he has ceased to move? Stop
shooting.... Give him time to recover....
Perhaps he is wounded."</p>

<p>It seemed that the Austrian fire grew
even more murderous.</p>

<p>Pinocchio, beside himself with fury,
rushed out of his hiding-place and in a
couple of bounds was back in the trench.</p>

<p>"They have wounded Bersaglierino....
He is there ... out there in the No Man's
Land.... Help him ... don't let him
die so."</p>

<p>They sprang over the top to rescue their
wounded comrades, but had scarcely gone
a step before they were lost to him.</p>

<p>Pinocchio lost his head. He sprang out
of the dugout and ran as fast as he could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
into the spot still illuminated by the ray of
silver. He stumbled, fell, got up again,
fell once more, but kept on crawling on his
hands and knees.... He heard a groan,
felt a body, lifted it in his arms, and, gathering
all his strength together, began to
drag it toward the trench. All at once he
felt his legs give way and he let out a yell of
terror. He was answered by another from
a hundred valiant throats; he saw a strange
flash, felt a hurricane strike him, a wave
roll over him ... but before losing his
senses there came to him the cry of victory.
The Italian bersaglieri had bayoneted those
who had wounded Bersaglierino and had
won from the enemy one more portion of
their country.</p>

<p>A little later the stretcher-bearers were
able to gather up the wounded from the
field of honor.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="center b13"><i>In Which Pinocchio Discovers That Sometimes
When You Want to Advance You
Have to Take a Step Backward</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span></p>
<p>For a long while Pinocchio didn't know
whether he was alive or dead. Then
after a time he seemed to be dreaming, but
the dreams were so queer that ... just
imagine, he thought he was a puppet again,
asleep on a chair with his feet resting on
a brazier full of lighted charcoal, that one
of his feet was on fire and that the flame,
little by little, was creeping up his leg.
And, just as once before when something
similar had happened, the dream became a
painful reality. However, there was another
dream that comforted him. A lovely
woman's smiling face would come close to
him and he would hear soft, affectionate
words. It was the queerest thing possible!
It seemed to him that this face was set in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
a lovely frame of light-blue hair which came
down like a veil, like a cape enfolding the
graceful form of a young girl. Some one
had told him that her name was Fatina,
and he kept repeating the name, as once ...
when he was still a little
puppet and the girl with
blue hair ... But what
had happened to him?</p>

<p class="p2">One morning he
opened his eyes and discovered
that he was in
a little white
bed in a
white room,
and that to
right and
left of him
in two other beds were two wounded men
all enveloped in bandages.</p>

<div class="figright" >
<img src="images/im_100.jpg" width="240" height="236" alt="Fatina" />
</div>

<p>"Bersaglierino! Bersaglierino!" cried Pinocchio,
trying to raise himself up in bed.
But a horrid pain made him fall back on
the pillow and forced him to scream loudly.
The door of the little room opened and a
Red Cross nurse in her blue uniform entered
swiftly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! At last! But be good and don't
try to move! The Bersaglierino is here on
your right; he is better, but you must let
him be quiet, and you, too, need to rest."</p>

<p>"Tell me, Fatina, is the Bersaglierino
really alive?"</p>

<p>"Don't you see him? Here he is. When
he wakes up you can say a few words to
him. Yesterday he was so eager to know
about you, but you couldn't speak to him."</p>

<p>"Listen, Fatina, and I ... am I really
alive?"</p>

<p>"It seems so to me."</p>

<p>"But am I ... made of wood or ..."</p>

<p>"You are made of iron."</p>

<p>"Of iron? Don't joke so with me, Fatina.
If you want my nose to grow longer,
dearest lady, or if you want me to turn back
into a wooden puppet, I am ready to do so;
but not of iron, no. I am too afraid of rust."</p>

<p>"But what are you talking about? Let
me feel your pulse. No, that's all right,
no fever. I said you were made of iron
because you have come out of it all so wonderfully.
You were threatened with gas
gangrene, and if they had not amputated
at once, it would have been the end of you,
but instead ..."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span></p>

<p>"Please, please ... what did they do
to me?"</p>

<p>"They cut off your injured leg."</p>

<p>"My leg!"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed; they couldn't help it."</p>

<p>"And when did they cut it off?"</p>

<p>"Three days ago."</p>

<p>"You are perfectly certain of this?"</p>

<p>"I was present."</p>

<p>"And I ... wasn't I present?"</p>

<p>"I think so."</p>

<p>"And how is it I didn't know anything
about it?"</p>

<p>"You were asleep."</p>

<p>"I think it was you who were dreaming.
Look."</p>

<p>Before Fatina could stop him Pinocchio
caught the covers and threw them off. One
leg was indeed missing and just the one
which he had dreamed had been burned by
the brazier. He saw a heap of bloody bandages
and let out such a scream that he
made the other two wounded start up.</p>

<p>The one on the left, who looked like a
monk in a hood, because from under the
bands which bound his head a long shaggy
beard was sticking out, cried in annoyance:</p>

<p>"Heh! What is it, a locomotive? You
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
are making as much noise as an enemy's
cannon."</p>

<p>"Be quiet, be quiet!"</p>

<p>"Bersaglierino, have you seen what they
did to me? They've carried off one of my
legs without asking my permission."</p>

<p>"And they took off one of my arms, and
they've made a hole in my head and cut
open my stomach."</p>

<p>"But what kind of dirty tricks are these?
I want my leg.... I want my leg!"</p>

<p>"If it were still on you it would be all
swollen and black. Be silent, shut up, and
thank God that they haven't taken the
other one. Because Major Cutemup is
here, and when he begins to amputate it is
hard to get him to stop. Imagine, they
wanted to cut off my nose."</p>

<p>"I want my leg!"</p>

<p>"Be good."</p>

<p>"Fatina, I beg you, make them make me
another one. Write to Geppetto to make
me another one, even of wood, but I want
to be able to walk and run. I want to go
back to the war, I do!"</p>

<p>The patient on the left jumped out of his
bed and, in giving him a kiss, brushed his
face with his bushy beard.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span></p>

<p>"There, you are a brave boy. You
please me.... We will have another leg
made for you, and if you want to go back
to see the Boches you can come with me.
Sister Fatina, is it not
true that they're going
to make him a new
leg?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"Of wood?"</p>

<p>"And with machinery
inside so that you
can move it as if it
were a real leg."</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/im_104.jpg" width="159" height="314" alt="The Surgeon" />
</div>

<p>"Then ..."</p>

<p>"Will you be
good?"</p>

<p>"Yes ... but as soon
as I catch sight of
Major Cutemup I'll
tell him a few things I
think of him."</p>

<p>"How are you, Bersaglierino?"</p>

<p>"Better, Fatina dear."</p>

<p>"Be brave."</p>

<p>Then she moved softly away, as noiseless
as a dream.</p>

<p>"Did you see, Pinocchio? Fatina kept
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
her word. She had scarcely heard that I
was wounded before she hurried to my bed.
She is an angel and I am quite happy. But
I owe it to you that I am alive. I had four
bullets in my back.... Those dogs had
got the range on me, and if you hadn't
come to my aid they would have finished
me.... And you weren't lucky, either&mdash;they
shot your leg to pieces, and if the company
hadn't appeared ... But we won!
Hurrah for Italy!"</p>

<p>"And Mollica?"</p>

<p>"Dead. They found him near the wire,
surrounded by a heap of dead enemies.
He made a regular slaughter. He had your
letter to Franz Joseph stuck on the end of
his bayonet. Every time that he hit a foe
he cried, 'Beast of a potato-eater, take this
letter and carry it to your Joey.'"</p>

<p>"Poor Mollica! If I am able to get back
there I'll avenge you."</p>

<p>"I told you I wanted you with me.
You will see what we'll do to those creatures.
I am Captain Teschisso, of the
Second Regiment of Alpine Troops. What
fights we have had! How we have 'strafed'
them! A shell splinter gave me a whack
and carried off one of my ears, but if you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
join me we'll have dozens of them every
day."</p>

<p>"Will I go with you? Yes, indeed, if the
Bersaglierino ..."</p>

<p>"As far as I am concerned, do what
you've a mind to. I shall never return to
the regiment now.... You can't make war
without an arm, but ..."</p>

<p>Just at this moment the door of the little
white room opened and Major Cutemup,
followed by two young lieutenants, Fatina,
and some men nurses, came in. He was
a short, squatty little man, with smooth
face and tiny eyes hidden behind gold-rimmed
glasses, and with a stomach that
would have made an alderman jealous.
He looked more like a cab-driver than like
an officer, and even more like a butcher who
has risen to be master of a shop by selling
old beef for veal.</p>

<p>"Good morning, boys. You are getting
on finely, eh? When I take hold of you
you either die or are better off than you
were before anything happened to you.
Let's look at you, Bersaglierino. The arm's
doing well ... the wound in your head
will be healed in ten days or so. Thank
God that I saved your eye. It was a risk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
... we ought to have taken it out if we
had followed the usual method.... No,
no, I find you in good condition, so good, in
fact, that I can tell you a piece of news
... they have recommended you for the
silver medal. I believe his Majesty will
come in person to pin it on your breast.
It would be a real honor for our hospital.</p>

<p>"And you, lad? But really I don't need
to bother about you, either. Boys are like
lizards&mdash;you can cut them in pieces and they
keep on living."</p>

<p>"Please, please, Mr. Major Carve-Beefsteak,
I should like to know who gave you
permission to cut off my leg."</p>

<p>"What? What? You dare ..."</p>

<p>"There's no good lecturing me, because I
am not in the army, as poor Mollica used
to say, so you don't frighten me worth a
soldo. So I am just asking you who gave
you permission to ... carry off my claw."</p>

<p>"Your claw? The femur was broken,
the tibia cracked, the patella shattered,
your temperature up over a hundred, delirium,
threatened with gas gangrene.... I
couldn't wait until you had gone to the
devil before asking your permission to amputate.
And, moreover, no more words
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
about it. I cut when it's my duty to cut.
If, in spite of the operation, the gangrene
had continued I should have amputated
your other leg as well. So let's look at it.
Nurse, undo the bandages."</p>

<p>In a minute the bloody flesh was uncovered.
Pinocchio bit his lips in order to
keep from yelling with pain. Cutemup
approached in a solemn manner, and, nearsighted
as he was, had almost to stick his
nose into the wound to make his examination.</p>

<p>"Fine.... The healing process has already
begun ... the granulation is splendid,
but have you any pain in the groin,
boy?"</p>

<p>"How in the world do you expect me to
know what that is?"</p>

<p>"Does it hurt you here?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Have you any pain in the sound leg?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Can you move it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Bend it at the knee."</p>

<p>"I am doing it."</p>

<p>"Again, again, again. Does it pain you?"</p>

<p>"No."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span></p>

<p>"Fine!... Now stretch it out."</p>

<p>He should never have said that. Pinocchio
stretched it out with such agility that
there was no difference from the way he
usually administered his solemnest kicks.
His foot caught Cutemup right in the stomach
and knocked him breathless into the
arms of the young lieutenant, who had
to resort to artificial respiration to revive
him.</p>

<p>The Alpine soldier broke out into such
an astonishing laugh from beneath his bandages
and his beard that the others, Fatina
included, had to echo him. Pinocchio
played 'possum, perfectly still with his eyes
half closed. When Cutemup, quite recovered,
sprang toward him to give vent to his
just vengeance, he seemed much surprised
to see him in such a state. He examined
him attentively, and, keeping himself a respectful
distance away, poked with his forefinger
two or three times the leg which had
given him such marvelous proof of vitality
and energy, then, turning to his colleagues,
he began to speak in an imposing manner:</p>

<p>"The accident which befell me was the
result of the nervous depression of the patient.
The reflex motions have superiority
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
over the will centers. The muscles slacken
at the lightest pressure, like a cord of a
strung bow. The vitality shown by the patient
is due to a nervous over-excitation,
not noticeable until now. I shall keep the
patient under observation. If you come
across similar cases, take notes of them that
I may include them in my article. I shall
order extra nutrition and care in building
up the patient as soon as the wound has
healed completely. Sister Fatina, note for
the boy special rations of filet of beefsteak,
roast chicken, eggs, custards well-sweetened,
at dinner and again at supper."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="foot" id="foot"></a>
<img src="images/im_110.jpg" width="400" height="240" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p class="center">HIS FOOT CAUGHT CUTEMUP RIGHT IN THE STOMACH AND KNOCKED HIM BREATHLESS</p>
</div></div>

<p>At this bill of fare Pinocchio's leg by
some strange phenomenon began to bend
again from the knee.</p>

<p>The major, thoroughly absorbed in his
lesson, did not notice it: "So, then, that is
understood. You, Captain Teschisso, are
doing splendidly; in a few days we'll take
the bandage off you. Gentlemen, let us go
into the next room."</p>

<p>They had scarcely gone out and the door
was scarcely closed before Pinocchio burst
out into such a hearty laugh that the captain
and Bersaglierino had to laugh, too.</p>

<p>"You don't seem too much depressed."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span></p>

<p>"What were you doing with that leg in
the air?"</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/im_113.jpg" width="400" height="219" alt="Special Nourishment" />
</div>

<p>"Do you know, Captain, as my first kick
had gained special nourishment for me, I
wanted to give him another one so that I
could get a double quantity; then there
would have been something for all of you."</p>

<p>"Thank you, you shaved poodle."</p>

<p>Just then Fatina returned and was surprised
to see Pinocchio laughing so hard
that his tongue was hanging out with happiness.</p>

<p>"What's this?"</p>

<p>"Fatina, my compliments. Did you hear
what the major ordered? Filet of beefsteak,
chickens, custards with heaps of
sugar, at dinner and again at supper."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span></p>

<p>"You wretch!"</p>

<p>"I am not a wretch; I am a poor, weak
invalid and no one had better feel the muscles
in my legs too much who doesn't want
to get kicks in the stomach."</p>

<p>"You little beast! Suppose I go and tell
the major that ..."</p>

<p>"No, for Heaven's sake! Dear Fatina,
keep quiet."</p>

<p>"On one condition."</p>

<p>"Let's hear it."</p>

<p>"That you will be good, that you will
be patient and let yourself be taken care
of until it is time to fit your wooden leg."</p>

<p>"I promise you. You know, once I was
made of wood all over. In order to get
ahead I can even make up my mind to
take a step backward."
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="center b13"><i>Wherein We See Pinocchio's Heart</i></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span></p>

<p>All three of them were now up again.
It was to be for them a day of great
gladness. Yet all three were in a bad humor.
They didn't even talk. Captain Teschisso,
dressed in a brand-new uniform, couldn't
tear himself away from the mirror, which he
addressed in a low voice:</p>

<p>"Just see what they have made of me.
I can't go on this way.... I am not presentable.
Without an ear, with a slash on
the cheek, half my beard gone ... I look
like a wild animal to be shown at a circus.
Lord! How many kicks I'd like to give
those dogs! They've botched me so I'm no
longer fit for this world.... It's against
the regulations, but before I die I want to
devour heaps of those curs! Who allows
them to make war like this? Who permits
them to reduce a captain of Alpine troops
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
to such a sight? It would be better for me
to die at once. I'm not good for anything,
and that dog of a Cutemup might have
made a better job of me. Let him show
himself and I'll give him a piece of my
mind."</p>

<p>Poor Teschisso! He was right! His ugly
scar did disfigure him. Another man would
have wept at seeing himself thus; he trembled
with eagerness to be revenged.</p>

<p>Pinocchio, too, was grumbling like a stewpot,
giving vent to his ill humor. They
had put on him a wooden leg that was a
real triumph of mechanism. It was jointed
like a real one and moved with an automatic
motion in harmony with his sound leg.
Pinocchio had tried to run, to jump, and to
balance, and had to convince himself that
he had not lost anything by the exchange.
But the leg had one fault&mdash;when he extended
it it unbent too rapidly, hitting the
heel on the ground with a noisy and annoying
sound. And in addition to this the
mechanism, which was still so new, rattled.</p>

<p>"Plague take it! My own didn't need
to be oiled. Who knows how much oil this
one will expect me to give it? But that
I'll make Mr. Cutemup pay for. If he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
comes up to me and repeats that I am better
than I used to be I'll plant another kick in
his stomach, then I'll ask how he would
manage to walk
if it were his, on
the tip of his
toes, with this
heel that beats
like a drumstick."</p>

<div class="figleft" >
<img src="images/im_117.jpg" width="217" height="328" alt="Wooden Limbs" />
</div>

<p>The Bersaglierino,
too,
had a wooden
left arm. You
wouldn't even
have noticed it.
He could move
it in any direction,
and the
gloved artificial
hand
which came out
of the sleeve of his gray jacket, although
a little stiff, could be moved as easily as a
real hand. The wound that furrowed his
forehead didn't disfigure him; indeed, it
gave to his gentle features a certain air of
nobility and fierceness. But the Bersaglierino
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
was sad, so sad that if you had looked
into his eyes you would have been certain
that he had to make a great effort not to
cry. Pinocchio noticed it.</p>

<p>"Tell me, Bersaglierino, what was your
business before the war?"</p>

<p>"What's that to you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I just want to know."</p>

<p>"I was a journalist, a writer."</p>

<p>"Hm! Must be a horrid profession."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because you have to work so hard not
to die of hunger."</p>

<p>"Who told you so?"</p>

<p>"Nobody. But if you had made a lot of
money in your job you wouldn't have left
it to volunteer, and as you get only fourteen
cents a day as a volunteer at the front,
as a civilian you must have been hard up all
the year. Then ... you needn't make a
face ... you don't write with the left
hand ... so you can go back to being
a journalist, even with ... the Austrian
improvement."</p>

<p>He hoped to drive away his sadness by
saying it in this way, but instead he only
increased it.</p>

<p>"Leave me in peace, puppet!" he said,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
roughly and with such a stern tone that Pinocchio
in his turn longed to cry.</p>

<p>At this moment the door of the room was
opened with great violence and Major Cutemup,
as if hurled by a catapult, made his
appearance, followed by Fatina and by a
regiment of soldiers and nurses. He was
red as the comb of a cock at his first crow,
wheezed every now and then like a pair of
bellows, and dripped sweat as a bucket just
out of the well drips water.</p>

<p>"Sister Fatina, I rely on you ... I rely
on you to see that everything is in order.
Four soldiers will wash the windows ...
six will scrub the floors, which must shine
like a mirror, and everything must be done
in ten minutes. And you, boys, put on
your special uniforms.... I have great
news for you. His Majesty has announced
his visit to the hospital; with his own august
hands he will bestow the decorations. You,
Bersaglierino, who are among these fortunate
ones, take care to be irreproachable in
your appearance. You, Captain ..."</p>

<p>"What! What did he say? Do you
think I can let his Majesty see me in this
frightful condition? Half a beard, half a
mustache, minus an ear, half a face ..."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span></p>

<p>"But ... I don't know what you can
do about it. Fix it up the best you can."</p>

<p>"Certainly I'll fix it up, I'll ... Good
Heavens! man, let me go to a barber who
can make me look like a Christian, because
you, Major Cutemup, have made me resemble
one of Menelik's crew."</p>

<p>"But ..."</p>

<p>"But I swear that I won't let the dogs
who got me in this condition stick their
fingers on my face, I tell you."</p>

<p>"Teschisso!"</p>

<p>"No, I won't let them touch me."</p>

<p>"Captain Teschisso, I must remind you
of the respect due ..."</p>

<p>"What's that? Major Cutemup ...
did you think I was talking of you? Not a
thought of doing so. I meant those dogs
of Austrians."</p>

<p>"A-a-a-h! Then be off to the barber's."</p>

<p>"Thanks. I'll have him fix me up in a
minute."</p>

<p>"Boy, hurry up. His Majesty is coming."</p>

<p class="p2">Ten minutes later everything was shining
like a mirror. The soldiers were already at
work in the adjoining room. Pinocchio had
disappeared. Teschisso had gone to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
shaved. Fatina was arranging the white
window-curtains. The Bersaglierino was
seated on his bed, his right arm resting on
his knee and his chin held in the hollow of
his hand.</p>

<p>"What's the matter? What is it, Bersaglierino?"</p>

<p>He didn't answer, and Fatina, after having
looked at him a minute with her large,
soft eyes, came up nearer and sat down beside
him on the little white bed.</p>

<p>"Tell me what's the trouble, Bersaglierino.
Why are you crying? Why don't
you make yourself handsome? Didn't you
hear? The King is coming to give you the
medal."</p>

<p>"Why should I care about that? What
do you think that means to me, Fatina?"</p>

<p>And then, since she seemed much astonished
at his words, he continued, vehemently:</p>

<p>"Why, indeed, should I care about that?...
After they have sent me away from
here I shall go back to living alone like a
dog ... to fighting every day for my existence.
Who will get any satisfaction from
the reward the King's hand has bestowed
on me? No one. Perhaps the day will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
come when I shall have to pin the medal
on my coat to keep the boys in the streets
from making fun of me, the poor maimed
creature who will wander about playing a
street-organ."</p>

<p>"Oh, Bersaglierino! I never imagined
you could talk like that. I don't want you
to talk so."</p>

<p>And she spoke with so much feeling that
he, fearing he had offended her, started to
beg her pardon:</p>

<p>"Fatina ..."</p>

<p>"Tell me, aren't you glad to have done
your duty, to have given your blood for
your country? Didn't you volunteer?
Didn't you go willingly through the barbed
wire to open a road of victory for your
country? And now you are almost blaming
yourself for the good you have done, for
fear of the morrow. And you think yourself
destined to end as a laughing-stock of
horrid little children? Oh, but you are bad!
Tell me, are you really so sure that you are
alone in the world, that there is no one who
will rejoice to see shining on your breast
the medal your country has bestowed on
you?"</p>

<p>"Ah, if it were so, Fatina, if it were true!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you believe that no one has followed
you in thought through all your dangers
on the field of honor, that no one suffered,
knowing you were wounded, or trembled at
the thought of your bed of pain? Do you
really believe that there is no one to rejoice
at seeing you take up again your place
in the world? You are young, full of ardor
and intelligence ..."</p>

<p>"But I am poor, so poor!"</p>

<p>"You can get rich by working. You
fought the war with weapons; continue it
with the pen. Write what you have seen;
you will make a name for yourself and
some day will be the pride of your family."</p>

<p>"I! Don't make fun of me, Fatina. I,
wounded, maimed, will never find a woman
to link her life with mine."</p>

<p>"Bersaglierino, I, too, am alone in the
world, free to dispose of myself. I am not
rich, but I have enough to live on; I am
not a professor, but I am widely educated....
I will be frank; if to-morrow a brave
man like you, in the same condition, should
come and ask me ..."</p>

<p>"To be his wife?"</p>

<p>"I should say yes, and I should be proud.
Do you understand? Proud of him and of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
the medal shining on his breast, which would
seem like my own...."</p>

<p>"Oh! Fatina, Fatina!"</p>

<p>He could say no more. Tears choked
him. But she looked at him tenderly with
her kind eyes, and in them, too two large
tears were shining.</p>

<p>Pinocchio could not stand any more of
this. For half an hour he had been hidden
under the bed, had therefore listened to
this noble dialogue, and had had to bite his
lips to keep from crying. But as it was not
amusing he could not stand it any longer.
He crawled very quietly from his hiding-place,
approached Fatina and Bersaglierino
cautiously and without their seeing him or
being able to put up any resistance, he
gathered the two heads in his arms, brought
them close together, and held them close,
covering them both with kisses.</p>

<p>Pinocchio's generous and lovable impulse
had found the way to unite these two
beings whom destiny had brought together.
The picture they made was interesting and
touching and would have touched every one
who knew them, if at this moment Captain
Teschisso had not entered, quite made over
by the barber.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span></p>

<p>"What ... what are you doing? Aren't
you preparing for the august visit?"</p>

<p>"Augusta? Who's she?"</p>

<p>"What? Don't you know that the King,
the commander-in-chief of our army, the
first soldier of New Italy, the head of the
state, the corporal of the Zouaves, like his
grandfather before him, the flower of gentlemen,
a good father of his family, one of
the wisest sovereigns of Europe...? In
short, you'll see him soon. Hurry up, because
when I came in the royal automobile
had been sighted.... Don't you think
that dog of a barber fixed me up fine?
Anyway, he was able to get rid of the half
of my beard which the Germans shaved with
a shell."</p>

<p>The King? This short word frightened
Pinocchio terribly. This man who commanded
everybody, who could put everybody
in prison, who was named Majesty,
August, and Victor Emanuel all at the same
time, who caused the rooms to be polished
in five minutes, who set Cutemup to trembling,
who kept all the wounded in the hospital
in order, all of them men of valor who
had held their own against hundreds of the
foe&mdash;frightened him like a hobgoblin or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
something similar. At the very thought
of having his glance fall upon him he felt
goose-flesh all over his body.</p>

<p>"It isn't fear; it is lack of courage or
something of that sort, but I must get out of
the way. I have never had anything to do
with kings and I don't know much about
the way they think. If Augusta, or his
Majesty, is in a bad humor and should find
my presence among the soldiers out of
order, he can bat his eye at Cutemup, make
him a sign, and ... whack! ... my head
would roll on the ground. Wouldn't that
murderer of a surgeon be glad to be revenged
for the kick I gave him in the stomach?
Yes, I must find some way ..."</p>

<p>His musings were interrupted by three
bugle notes which brought every one to
attention.</p>

<p>"There he is! There he is!"</p>

<p>Then resounded enthusiastic hurrahs for
the King.</p>

<p>Pinocchio disappeared under Bersaglierino's
bed ... popped up again, disguised
himself, and no one noticed that ...</p>

<p>Captain Teschisso and the Bersaglierino
stood at attention at the foot of their beds,
straight and immovable, awaiting the royal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
visit. The King in his soldier way entered
without ceremony, followed by his aide-de-camp,
General Win-the-War, Major Cutemup,
and a number of other officers of the
garrison, Red Cross nurses, and other
wounded who had come from their rooms
to take part in the ceremony. It didn't
seem possible that the room could hold so
many persons, but all of them crowded in,
squeezing together in order to see the King
and to be near to him. And his face, which
was wrinkled, was illuminated by a kindly
smile that spread out from his thick mustache
grown prematurely white. He gave
Teschisso a military salute, then shook his
hand vigorously and said:</p>

<p>"I am so pleased to see you recovered.
I am sure that when you go back to your
regiment I shall hear more of you. You
Alpine troopers are all of you wonderful
soldiers."</p>

<p>"For Italy and for our King, your Majesty."</p>

<p>"For our Italy greater than ever."</p>

<p>"She shall be, if we have to shed all our
blood."</p>

<p>"Such is my belief."</p>

<p>Major Cutemup had suddenly turned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
crimson with rage, and approached Fatina,
his large, angry eyes scowling at her from
behind his eyeglasses.</p>

<p>"Why have you treated me so?" he asked,
in a low, furious voice.</p>

<p>"I?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I told you to put everything in
order."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Look at that mess!" and he nodded toward
a kind of clothes-hanger near the head
of Bersaglierino's bed, on which were hung
a hat with cock plumes, a coat, with a pair
of trousers all torn and ragged and dirty.
It was the uniform the brave young soldier
had worn on the field and which Fatina
had hidden under the bed a little while ago.</p>

<p>Fatina didn't know what to say. The
sudden appearance of this clothes-hanger,
... those clothes spread out, affected her
so that she had no thought of the major or
of his rage, which escaped in such violent
outbursts that they would have started a
windmill going.</p>

<p>The King had approached Bersaglierino,
and General Win-the-War presented him,
with these words:</p>

<p>"Your Majesty, this brave soldier has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
been proposed for the medal of valor for
the following reasons: enrolled as a volunteer,
he took part in the first battles with
the enemy, giving an example of courage
and discipline; he volunteered to blow up
the enemy wire defenses; he carried out
the assignment given him, and, unhurt himself,
he tried to free a comrade caught on
the barbed wire and managed to put to
flight an enemy patrol which attacked him.
Then he was hit several times by machine-gun
fire. Carried to the first-aid station, he
showed the greatest self-control and cheered
for his King and his country when he learned
that his efforts had enabled his company to
take an important trench from the enemy."</p>

<p>The King took from the hand of his adjutant
a silver medal hung from a light-blue
ribbon and pinned it on Bersaglierino's
breast, who was so pale with emotion that
he looked as if he would faint, then clasped
the soldier's right hand in both of his and
said:</p>

<p>"Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! You have done
your duty as an Italian soldier. Treasure
this medal which your country gives
you by the hand of your King. Wear it
always proudly on your breast. Every one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
should know that you deserve it and that
they should follow your example....
You are crying? But it is with happiness,
is it not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, your Majesty."</p>

<p>"And now that you have recovered,
what will you do?"</p>

<p>"I shall go back to my profession. I am
a journalist."</p>

<p>"And ... will you be able?"</p>

<p>"I hope so. I was very severely
wounded, but ..."</p>

<p>"You cured him, Major Cutemup?"</p>

<p>"I myself, your Majesty; he was one of
the worst cases. The left arm carried away
by a shell splinter, wounded on the temple,
and threatened with damage to his eye,
wounded in his third upper rib and another
wound in the groin with lesion in the intestines.
An abdominal operation was performed,
his arm was amputated and there
was a suture in the occipital region....
The poor fellow has certainly had his share."</p>

<p>"You can see that by looking at his glorious
uniform; it is indeed a document."</p>

<p>The uniform in question trembled and
the plumed hat shook.</p>

<p>"Yes ... truly ... but ..."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span></p>

<p>"Would you deny it?"</p>

<p>"No, your Majesty, I wanted to say that
that uniform shouldn't be there just now.
It is a glorious object, but in a hospital
ward it may have infectious germs....
I had given orders to ... but ... and if
your Majesty will permit, I will give orders
to remove it at once."</p>

<p>He had scarcely finished speaking when
the coat, trousers, and hat suddenly fell to
the ground with such a curious noise that
Cutemup could not help running up to see
what had happened. Imagine how he
looked when he found himself face to face
with Pinocchio, cold with terror. He tried
to hide him with the glorious garments in
order to carry him off, bundled up in them,
but the King turned and asked:</p>

<p>"What's happened?"</p>

<p>"Your Majesty, I don't know how to explain
it.... Under these clothes was hidden
a wretch who ..."</p>

<p>"Ah! I saw. I know him. Pinocchio
is one of my old and dear acquaintances.
I am glad to see him among my soldiers,
in semi-military garb. Leave to Bersaglierino
this uniform that is dear to him. It
will be a glorious souvenir for his family.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
Good-by, brave soldier; remember your
King. I called to you in the hour of need;
if to-morrow you have need of me, remember
that I shall never forget those who have
served me on the battle-field."</p>

<p>And the good King, the loving father, the
model soldier, turned to leave, followed by
his suite.</p>

<p>Before he had crossed the threshold Pinocchio
had sprung to his feet, flung him
two kisses with the tips of his fingers, and
began to dance like mad with happiness.
His wooden leg made a horrible noise. Fatina,
fearing Cutemup's anger, begged him
to behave.</p>

<p>"What? What? If Cutemup scolds me,
woe to him. Did you hear? The King is
an old acquaintance of mine. If he gets
offended with me, I'll take out my paper
and pen and inkstand and I will write:
'Dear King, you are the best and kindest
man in the world, but do me the favor to
cut off the head, or some other organ, from
the major who amputated my leg without
permission. In this world an eye for an eye,
a head for a leg. Many kisses from your
Pinocchio.'"
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="center b13"><i>How Pinocchio Came Face to Face with Our
Alpine Troops</i></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span></p>

<p>If you had come across him unexpectedly
in his new costume I assure you
you would not have recognized him. On
his head was a woolen helmet from which
emerged only his eyes and the point of his
nose; on his back was a short coat of goatskin
which swelled him out like a German
stuffed with beer and sausage; his legs
were lost in a pair of big boots with lots
of nails. Around his waist was a huge belt
of leather from which hung a number of
small rope ends, and in his hand he carried a
splendid stick with an iron point. Captain
Teschisso was a gentleman and wanted his
new orderly to be magnificently equipped.
That odd creature of a mountaineer amused
himself thoroughly with the rascal Pinocchio.
It didn't seem real to see him struggling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
to conquer the mountain peaks and
ready to fight those dogs of Austrians who
were up there and with whom he had so
many accounts to settle.
They had arrived
one morning at Fort
&mdash;&mdash; (censor). Teschisso
had been
greeted like one raised
from the dead. Finally
the soldiers had
thrown their arms
about his neck and
kissed and hugged him.
They all seemed like
one family, and for a
fact they did all resemble
one another a
little: tall, with extraordinary
beards, with
muscular legs straight as a column and hands
that seemed made to give vigorous blows.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/im_134.jpg" width="156" height="291" alt="Coat of Goatskin" />
</div>

<p>"Where is my company?"</p>

<p>"On &mdash;&mdash; [oh, that censor!], at nine thousand
feet altitude."</p>

<p>"All well?"</p>

<p>"'Most all."</p>

<p>"And the Boches, where are they?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span></p>

<p>"Bah! We've got them on the run."</p>

<p>"Send my things up to me with the first
supply division; I'm off now at once."</p>

<p>"Nine feet of snow and a biting wind."</p>

<p>"Heavens! If I were sure of finding that
dog who cut my beard I would go to hell
itself."</p>

<p>"I am thinking less of you than of your
little orderly."</p>

<p>"Ha! That youngster has a wooden leg
and is as hardy as a goat."</p>

<p>Pinocchio, to show off, whirled his leg
around and with a shy glance convinced
himself that in a wink of the eye he had
won the respect of the little garrison.</p>

<p class="p2">"Listen, Captain, if you give me something
to eat I'll go ahead; if you don't,
here's where I stay."</p>

<p>"Indeed!"</p>

<p>"How indeed! Did you understand that
I am hungry?"</p>

<p>"And I have nothing more to give you
to eat."</p>

<p>"And I stop here."</p>

<p>"You'll get caught in a blizzard and
buried in snow and will be frozen hard like
Neapolitan ice-cream."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span></p>

<p>"But ... I'm hungry."</p>

<p>"You have eaten two rations of bread,
a box of conserved beef, nearly half a pound
of chocolate ..."</p>

<p>"Is it my fault if the air of these mountains
makes me as hungry as a wolf? You
should have told me before we left. Now
I know why you are always saying that you
would like to eat so many Austrians. But
if you think I can get used to the same
diet you are much mistaken."</p>

<p>"Are you coming or aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Is it much farther?"</p>

<p>"Do you see that cloud up there?"</p>

<p>"I defy any one not to see it."</p>

<p>"When that is passed there is a crack in
the mountain called Spaccata; we must
cross that and we are there&mdash;at least if they
haven't gone on ahead."</p>

<p>"In the clouds? Really in the clouds?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"Listen, Captain, do I really seem to you
as much of a fool as that?"</p>

<p>"Just now, yes."</p>

<p>"Thanks, but you can go in the clouds
by yourself; I'll turn back and bid you
farewell."</p>

<p>He tried to make one of his usual pirouettes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
to turn around, but the snow slipped
under his feet and he fell, sitting down, and,
sliding on the white surface, was precipitated
down the slope of the mountain with
terrifying speed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/im_137.jpg" width="336" height="339" alt="Sliding" />
</div>

<p>"Help! Help!"</p>

<p>"Stick your staff in! Stick your staff
in!" yelled Teschisso, who already believed
him lost.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span></p>

<p>He had need to yell. Pinocchio was flying
along like a little steamer under forced
draught and couldn't hear anything, I assure
you. Suddenly he stopped as if he were
nailed to the snow. That was to be expected,
you say, with that air of superior
beings you assume every now and then.
I know&mdash;but I can tell you Pinocchio didn't
expect it, nor even Teschisso, who was leaping
down to help his little friend.</p>

<p>"Are you hurt?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Do you feel ill?"</p>

<p>"No, not exactly ill, but I suffered terribly
from&mdash;lack of courage."</p>

<p>"Why don't you get up?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid of sliding off again."</p>

<p>"Let me help you."</p>

<p>Captain Teschisso took hold of the rope
Pinocchio had tied around his waist and
pulled one end of it through his leather belt,
fastened the other end round his body, and,
after planting his feet firmly, said: "Take
hold of the rope and pull yourself up. You
are quite safe; the mountain will crumble
before I fall."</p>

<p>Pinocchio did his best to get on his feet,
but couldn't succeed. His hinder parts adhered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
to the crust of the snow as if some
magician had glued them firmly. Teschisso,
who had little patience and thought
that Pinocchio was feigning in order not to
have to climb the mountain, gave such a
vigorous pull on the rope tied to the boy's
belt that he jerked him up, swung him
through the air for several feet, and flung
him face downward on a heap of snow as
downy as a feather-bed. A piece of gray
cloth left behind showed the spot where Pinocchio
had been miraculously halted in his
precipitous descent. Teschisso glanced at
it and couldn't keep back one of his loud,
honest mountain laughs. Pinocchio, believing
he was being swung around for fun,
sprang to his feet, so furious that the captain's
hilarity grew even stronger and
louder.</p>

<p>"Heavens! And you can thank Heaven
that you are still in the land of the living.
Look there and feel the back of your
trousers. Hah, hah, hah! Don't you understand
yet what has happened to you?
You were caught in a wolf-trap which the
Austrians put there to catch some of us,
and instead you were the one, which isn't
the same thing at all."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="succeed" id="succeed"></a>
<img src="images/im_140.jpg" width="353" height="550" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">PINOCCHIO DID HIS BEST TO GET ON HIS FEET, BUT COULDN'T
SUCCEED</p>
</div></div>

<p>Notwithstanding the laughter of the captain,
Pinocchio's anger evaporated in a second.
His eyes were fixed on the scraps of
his trousers that still hung on the teeth
of the trap and his hands were rubbing the
frozen surface left uncovered. He longed
to cry, and felt so ridiculous that he was
almost on the point of flinging himself again
down the snowy slope.</p>

<p>"Come on, come on! There's no time to
lose. There is a long road to go and the
clouds are hanging lower. There's no sense
in your staying there like a macaw, weeping
for the seat of your breeches. When
we arrive up there I'll have the company's
tailor mend them for you. You've got to
march, and no more nonsense. Forward,
march!"</p>

<p>"Captain, it's impossible."</p>

<p>"Heavens alive! How impossible?"</p>

<p>"I am not presentable."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"If we find the enemy and the Austrians
see me with my trousers in such a state,
they will say that the Italian army ..."</p>

<p>"Fool! The Italian army never turns
its rear to the enemy, and you won't,
either."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span></p>

<p>"But ..."</p>

<p>"If you are afraid of taking cold in your
spine that's another matter. If that's the
case let's see what can be done."</p>

<p>Captain Teschisso turned Pinocchio over,
took a copy of a newspaper out of his
pocket, folded it over four times, and stuck
it into the hole of the trousers. And he did
it so well that the "Latest News" with the
headlines seemed to be framed in the ragged
edges of the cloth.</p>

<p>"There you are. Are you satisfied?"</p>

<p>To tell the truth, he would have preferred
to consider a little before answering, but
the captain didn't give him the time. He
started off with a quick stride, pulling the
rope after him which he had fastened to his
belt, as if bringing a calf to the butcher.</p>

<p class="p2">I do not know if you, my children, have
ever been up in the high mountains. You
must know that after you reach a certain
altitude, whether because the air becomes
rarefied or because of the silence that surrounds
you, you seem to be living another
life in another world. Your breath grows
shorter; it seems as if you could not draw
a long one, while the lungs are so full of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
oxygen that the heart beats more rapidly;
then fatigue is followed by a condition of
strange torpor. Nevertheless, you continue
to climb without effort, as if the legs moved
automatically. If you speak, the voice
reaches the ears faintly as if it came from a
distance. Sometimes you have a certain
discomfort called mountain-sickness, which
makes the temples throb and brings with it
such a languor that the traveler is forced
to give up his ascent. Pinocchio, who for
some time had been experiencing all these
sensations peculiar to the high mountains,
found himself suddenly hidden in a fog so
thick that he couldn't see a hand's-breath
before his nose.</p>

<p>Not seeing Teschisso any more, and not
feeling his numbed legs move, and feeling
himself dragged upward and upward
through the darkness as if by some prodigious
force, he really imagined himself to
have entered a new world, and was seized
by such a terror that he began to scream
as if his throat were being cut. But, seeing
that his voice didn't carry far and that Teschisso
was not affected by it, he thought it
easier to let himself be dragged along and
to spare his breath for a better cause.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span></p>

<p>"I'd like to know where that creature is
dragging me," he began to grumble in a low
voice like a somnambulist in the dark to
give himself courage. "I'd like to know
where he is taking me. I am almost beginning
to believe that I am really in the
clouds, but I'd like to know what need there
is to climb 'way up here to fight when there
is plenty of room down below. Anyway, I
don't believe that we'll find a single Austrian
up here in the clouds; it's just a fancy
of the captain, who must be a trifle crazy.
Once I heard a country priest say that the
Heavenly Father lives in the clouds to let
the water down when the peasants need it
to water their cabbages and turnips, and to
keep the sun lighted to warm those who
have no clothes. It looks to me as if He
had let the Alpine troops take His place.</p>

<p>"Hum! Let's see how this is going to
come out. All I care about is to fill my
stomach when we arrive, because I am hungry
and can't stand it any longer. I've
been eating snow for an hour now, but I
don't get any nourishment from that. I
am beginning to think I was better off
where I was before. If Bersaglierino hadn't
been injured I'd still be with him and his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
fine regiment. At least down there I could
hear some noise ... patapin! patapum
... pum! Here there's nothing but snow
and ice, not a living person to be seen.
I should just like to know with whom we
can fight. In any case, if the Austrians
are up there it seems to me it'll be hard
to get close enough to bother them....
But it's easy to see that the air up there
isn't for me; I can scarcely go on, but if I
slip I'd have to fall all the way, as I did
this morning. If I hadn't been so frightened
I should almost have enjoyed it. I
went along like a trolley-car, and such
speed! But I left my trousers on the way.
A nice sight I'll be when I'm introduced to
the company with the newspaper on ...
the rear front! And, to tell the truth, it
doesn't keep me very warm. I feel a little
cold in my back. I don't know whether it
really comes from that, but I feel it, almost&mdash;if
I didn't feel so well&mdash;as if I were going
to be sick."</p>

<p>Teschisso noticed the dead weight on the
rope he was pulling and absent-mindedly
quickened his pace, so terrifyingly horizontal.
If the boy had fainted it wouldn't
be an easy matter to carry him to safety
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
in such weather. Although he knew the
rocks inch by inch, it was not easy to find
the way in the whiteness of the snow nor to
judge how much more of the road there
still remained to cover, on account of the
fog which hid the landscape. He was reproaching
himself for not having listened
to the advice of his comrades at the fort,
who had advised him to delay his climb,
when he heard a strange metallic noise
which grew stronger each moment.</p>

<p>"No so bad. Here we are!"</p>

<p>He took a few steps more, then, pulling
from his pocket a horn whistle, he blew
several short, shrill blasts. He was answered
by a dozen voices, one deep one
calling:</p>

<p>"Who goes there?"</p>

<p>"Friends."</p>

<p>"Pasquale."</p>

<p>"Pinerolo."</p>

<p>"I'm well. Who are you?"</p>

<p>"Captain Teschisso."</p>

<p>"Bah! Don't believe it."</p>

<p>"Here, you dog! I tell you it is I."</p>

<p>"Captain Teschisso is killed. Too bad.
I saw him fall down in the valley."</p>

<p>"Oh, did you, Sergeant Minestron?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll be dogged if it isn't he; it really is
he!"</p>

<p>From the fog emerged several Alpine figures;
they came nearer, growing more distinct,
and then there was a yell of delight.</p>

<p>"It is he in flesh and blood. Hurrah!"</p>

<p>"Hurrah for our captain!"</p>

<p>"Thank God that he is really alive."</p>

<p>"Lieutenant, Lieutenant, come here ...
a surprise!"</p>

<p>"Captain, how many surprises?"</p>

<p>"Let me get my breath; you are suffocating
me with your hugs. Where are
they?"</p>

<p>"The Austrians?"</p>

<p>"Heavens! Whom do you suppose I'm
talking about? I came up here for the
express purpose of getting even with them!"</p>

<p>"They are a long distance away, Captain.
We must transport our artillery up to
Mount X [censor]; there we'll go for them."</p>

<p>"And have you got the <i>filovia</i> [aerial
railway] in working order for that purpose?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed! They have been working
on it for three days."</p>

<p>"And the company?"</p>

<p>"They are intrenched in the hut on
Mount X with the battalion."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span></p>

<p>"It will take four good hours to get
there."</p>

<p>"Even more, Captain."</p>

<p>"And how will I manage to tow along
this lump of a Pinocchio who is half dead
with mountain-sickness?"</p>

<p>"Pinocchio?"</p>

<p>"Where is he?"</p>

<p>"Pull the rope and take him off my back;
he has tired me out."</p>

<p>Pinocchio, who was in a state of great
weakness and curiously sleepy, felt himself
lifted up and whirled around to the outburst
of loud laughter. It seemed to him
that something slipped down his throat
which burned and made him cough and
sneeze ... then he thought he was
stretched out on a bed that was rather hard,
but covered with warm and heavy coverings;
then ... he experienced a strange
feeling of comfort disturbed only by a long,
monotonous, persistent humming.</p>

<p>If he had been able to notice what was
happening to him he would either have died
of fright or he would have believed himself
in the very hands of God. Fastened to the
gun-carriage of a six-inch cannon, suspended
in the car of a <i>filovia</i>, he was traveling over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
the abyss which separates two of our giant
Alps. Below him was a sea of clouds, above
the beautiful blue sky, all about him the
gleam of white snow, and on the snow
here and there a group of little gray
points, like grains of sand lost in all this
immensity. Those were our Alpine troops,
the dear big boys who were laughing at
the joke played on Pinocchio, and defying
serenely all the obstacles that nature opposed
to their victorious advance on Italian
soil which Austria's power had for so many
years disputed with us.</p>

<p class="p2">When Pinocchio regained his senses he
found himself lying on the ground wrapped
up in coverlets and warm as a bun just out
of the oven. Above his head dangled horizontally
the huge basket from which he
had been flung by the shock of its sudden
halt, and which swung on the steel cables
of the <i>filovia</i> as if it were weary of being
up there and eager to set about its job.
All about was the gleam of the snow, even
though the light was growing paler every
moment. I bet you a soldo against a
lira what hour it was. But Pinocchio
guessed it from the odor of cooking which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
sweetened the air all about, an odor which
would have brought a dead dyspeptic to
life. He sniffed the air like a bloodhound,
rolled his eyes in every direction, in all
corners, to discover the spot whence came
the delicious fragrance, but couldn't see
anything but snow, nothing, not even a
curl of distant smoke. He was so hungry
that he thought he would faint.</p>

<p>"I am dreaming with eyes open. How
is it possible that there should be in this
desert pastry covered with caramel sauce?
Because I know I am not mistaken ...
the odor I smell is just that. If I had
only a piece of bread, by means of my
nose and by means of my mouth I could
fool myself into believing that I was
dining magnificently, but ..."</p>

<p>But the odor affected him so strongly that
he had to get up to limber up his muscles.
He had scarcely got to his feet when a
strange thing happened&mdash;from the very spot
where he had been lying a puff of smoke
rose gently upward, and this smoke had
precisely the odor of pastry covered with
caramel sauce.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/im_152.jpg" width="351" height="146" alt="Experimental Method" />
</div>

<p>Pinocchio crossed his hands over his
empty stomach and stood for a moment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
pondering. Never in all his life had he
had presented to him so difficult a problem
as this to solve. He thought and thought,
and, like Galileo, had recourse to the experimental
method. He knelt down in the
snow and began to scrape it away with his
hands on the spot where his body, covered
by the latest issue of the newspaper, had
left an impression. The smell of caramel
sauce kept growing more fragrant, and Pinocchio's
tongue licked the end of his nose
so solemnly that he would have made the
inventor of handkerchiefs blush with shame.
Suddenly a deep opening appeared under
the snow. Pinocchio stuck his arms in up
to the elbows and uttered a shriek of terror.
His hands and wrists were held as in a fiery
vise and his arms were pulled so violently
that he was jerked face down on the earth
and his nose stuck into the snow.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span></p>

<p>If he had not been in such an uncomfortable
position and had been able to look
over his shoulder he would have seen four
devils of Alpine troopers advancing very
quietly, guns pointed and bayonets fixed.
It could be only a starved Austrian who
would attempt to enter through the dugout's
little window cut through the snow
into the officers' mess, and they intended
giving him a fine welcome. A corporal with
a reddish beard which hung down to his
stomach stood two paces away, ready to
give him a bayonet thrust that would have
run him through like a snipe on a spit, but
suddenly he focused his eyes on a certain
point, advanced on his hands and knees,
and began to read the "Latest News"
which he had caught sight of in the seat
of Pinocchio's trousers.</p>

<p>The Alpine troops are the bravest soldiers
in the world; if any one doubts this
let him ask the hunters of that foolish gallows-bird
of an emperor; but they are not
all well educated, and for this reason Corporal
Scotimondo, as soon as he had spelled
out the interesting headline, signaled to his
comrades to advance cautiously.</p>

<p>You can't have the faintest idea of how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
important a newspaper becomes, even if
it is not a particularly late one, up there
among those snow-clad peaks where our soldiers
were fighting for a greater Italy. So
this editorial, which contained the news of
the miraculous conquest of the Col di Lana,
deserved to be preserved in the archives
among the masterpieces of our glory, instead
of in the seat of Pinocchio's trousers.</p>

<p>As I have told you, Corporal Scotimondo
could scarcely spell, but among his three
comrades Private Draghetta was looked
upon as a genius, because as a civilian
he had been a clerk in Cuneo. But Draghetta,
who could see the Austrians a
mile off and when he saw them never
failed to knock them over with a shot
from his gun, was nearsighted as a mole,
and when he wanted to read had to rub
his nose into the print.</p>

<p>When Pinocchio felt Draghetta's nose
tickle him he began to kick like a donkey
stung by a gadfly.</p>

<p>"Hold him tight; tie him. We've taken
the Col di Lana! The Col di Lana is
ours!"</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>"Is it true?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span></p>

<p>"Read it, Draghetta ... don't be afraid
... I'll hold him for you."</p>

<p>Scotimondo sat astride Pinocchio's back
and squeezed him with his knees so hard
that he took his breath away.</p>

<p>"'Yesterday our brave Alpine troops, supported
by infantry regiments, by means of
a brilliant attack gained the highest summit
of the Col di Lana, which is now safely
in our possession.' ... Hurrah!"</p>

<p>"Hurrah for Italy!"</p>

<p>"Hurrah for the King!"</p>

<p>They were crazy with joy and danced
about on the snow like fiends, throwing
their plumed hats up into the air, waving
their guns above their heads. Suddenly,
just as if they had risen from the ground,
a hundred soldiers appeared and surrounded
them.</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"What has happened?"</p>

<p>"The Col di Lana is ours!"</p>

<p>"Hurrah for Italy!"</p>

<p>"Who told you so?"</p>

<p>"Where did you hear it?"</p>

<p>"In the latest news of the <i>Corriere</i>."</p>

<p>"Are you certain?"</p>

<p>"Where did you find it?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span></p>

<p>"If you don't believe it, ask Draghetta."</p>

<p>All this noise, this rushing out of the
trenches and the soldiers staying in the
open, was against regulations, so that Lieutenant
Sfrizzoli couldn't let it pass without
giving vent to one of his usual fits of rage.
Red as a radish, he rushed toward Draghetta,
shoving apart the group of rejoicing
Alpine soldiers, and stopped in front of him,
legs wide apart, and with fists clenched.</p>

<p>"Is it you, Draghetta, who have set the
camp in such an uproar?"</p>

<p>"Not I, sir; it is the Col di Lana."</p>

<p>"What? What? What?"</p>

<p>"We've taken it, sir."</p>

<p>"Who told you?"</p>

<p>"I read it myself."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"On ... on ..."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"I don't want to be lacking in respect,
sir, to my superior officer, no matter what
the occasion may be ..."</p>

<p>"Stupid! Tell me where you read it."</p>

<p>"On the frontispiece of a book without
words belonging to an Austrian soldier
who ..."</p>

<p>Draghetta didn't succeed in getting out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
another word. Something interposed between
him and the lieutenant with a lightning-like
rapidity ... and he felt a terrible
kick in the shins which made him roll
over on the ground with pain.</p>

<p>"Mr. Lieutenant, it is I ... the scout
Pinocchio, under Captain Teschisso's protection.
I took part in the campaign on
the Isonzo and left a leg there and in its
place I now have a wooden leg of perfect
Italian manufacturing. He told you what
he thought was so, but I beg to convince
you of the contrary. But the news about
the Col di Lana is true, as true as can be.
Here is the <i>Corriere</i> which was on the frontispiece
... of my book without words, in the
seat of my trousers. But, as I can't stand
the cold, I beg you to have a patch put on
and to have served to me a plate of that
pastry cooked under the snow, because I
am so hungry I could eat even you."</p>

<p>Shortly after the delighted Pinocchio sat
in front of a dish piled high with spaghetti,
and surrounded by soldiers of the company
who never stopped asking him questions
about how the war was going down in the
plains. With his mouth full he kept turning
to this one and that one, uttering inarticulate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
sounds that might have come from
a sucking pig.</p>

<p class="p2">The arrival of Captain Teschisso was the
signal for a furious attack. He had seen in
the distance a long file of the enemy clad
in white shirts moving across the snow; he
had hurried to the dugout to give the alarm
and, taking command of the company, had
flung himself on the foe, who, relying too
much on the secrecy of his attack, was
beaten and put to flight.</p>

<p>Pinocchio had assisted in the action at a
loophole in the trench, armed with the finest
of spy-glasses. The Alpine troops had
performed prodigious deeds of valor. The
captain came back with two prisoners, one
a Hungarian and one a Croat, whom he held
by the collars as if they were two mice surprised
while robbing tripe from the larder.</p>

<p>"Heavens! What blows!" he cried, happily,
to the soldiers who surrounded him,
rejoicing. "But, boys, I won't let them
sleep to-night. We must get ready for an
attack in force. We must make these pigs
sing!"</p>

<p>There was no time to pay any attention
to them. A few moments later a rain of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
shells began to fall around the neighborhood
of the dugout. The Austrians wanted
to revenge themselves from a distance for
their sudden rout. Teschisso ordered four
mountain guns which had just arrived by
the <i>filovia</i> to be mounted on the gun-carriages,
assembled his men, and ran to take
up his position in an excavation nearly a
mile away whence it was possible to observe
the enemy's position. Pinocchio and
Ciampanella, the company cook, remained
behind to guard the dugout, and to them
had been assigned the care of the two
prisoners from whom Teschisso hoped later
to obtain some definite information.

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="center b13"><i>How Pinocchio Made Two Beasts Sing&mdash;Contrary
to Nature</i></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span></p>

<p>Excuse me, my children, for not having
presented Ciampanella to you before.
Ciampanella was a pure-blooded
Roman, born under the shadow of the
Capitol, like&mdash;the wolf kept at the cost
of the City Commune. If Francis Joseph
had seen him he would have appointed him
at once as royal hangman because he had
a gallows countenance and a body like a
gigantic negro. Yet he was the best-hearted
man in the world, so good that he wouldn't
harm a fly.</p>

<p>This evening he was in such a good
humor that he made even Pinocchio laugh,
whom the charge of the prisoners had made
as serious as a judge.</p>

<p>"Listen, youngster, don't bother yourself
with these two scoundrels whose throats
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
I'll cut some day with my kitchen knife as
if they were pigs, and so you will be freed
from the care of them, and I win back the
honor which I lose in feeding the enemies
of my country."</p>

<p>"Are you crazy?"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Didn't you hear what my captain said?
We must make them sing."</p>

<p>"Them sing? It's easier to make the
statue of Marcus Aurelius sing that's of
bronze and won't move from the Capitol
for fear the Councilors of the Commune
might take it to a pawnbroker's."</p>

<p>"But I've found out already what their
names are."</p>

<p>"I, too."</p>

<p>"Let's hear."</p>

<p>"Pigs."</p>

<p>"That is their family name, but the real
name of the Croat is Stolz and the Hungarian's
is Franz."</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"We've got to find out how many of
them are down there in the trenches; if
there are others behind them; how many
pieces of artillery they have and where;
from what point their munitions and supplies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
come, and how many officers are in
command of the troops."</p>

<p>"That's the easiest thing possible."</p>

<p>"You think so?"</p>

<p>"You ask them and they will answer."</p>

<p>"And if they pretend not to hear?"</p>

<p>"Leave it to me, youngster. I have a
special way of making myself understood,
even by the deaf. I didn't read for nothing
<i>The Spanish Inquisition</i>. Bring to me
here those two satellites of Franz Joe and
you'll hear the speeches I'll make them."</p>

<p>Ciampanella rubbed his ears, tied an
apron around his waist as when he entered
upon his official functions, filled up the little
stove with charcoal and lighted a fine fire.
When Pinocchio returned to the kitchen,
followed by the prisoners, a pair of tongs
and a shovel were heating on the red-hot
charcoal.</p>

<p>At the sight of these the Croat and the
Hungarian exchanged glances and a few
quick, dry phrases in their language.</p>

<p>Ciampanella advanced triumphantly to
within a foot of them, bowed like an actor
to an applauding audience, and unfolded
one of his most polished discourses:</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, our officers say that we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
must respect the enemy, and I respect you
according to command; but in case any one
should persist in refusing to speak, just like
the beasts, I should feel it my duty to treat
him like a beast, and my superiors would
say to me, 'Ciampanella, you're right.' I
explain this because we have need of certain
information, so we take the liberty of
asking you in secret certain things which
you, gentlemen, can answer, after which we
will give you special attention in our culinary
service. This is said and promised,
so I begin my questions. We want to
know how many men and how many officers
that big simpleton of your emperor has
whipped up together against us."</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>"What? Are you deaf? Don't you understand
modern Italian? Then I'll talk
ancient Roman to you."</p>

<p>Ciampanella grabbed from the stove the
red-hot shovel and waved it before the
Austrians' noses. Their eyes popped out
with fright, but they didn't utter a word.</p>

<p>"You will either answer or I will give
you two kisses with the shovel on your
right cheeks and two on your left."</p>

<p>"'Talian pigs! Brigands!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span></p>

<p>"May you be skinned alive! To call me
a brigand! Me! Pinocchio, which creature
is this, Spitz or Spotz?"</p>

<p>"Franz."</p>

<p>"Listen, Franz, if you dare insult me
another time, I'll untie your hands and
then I'll give you so many boxes on your
ear that'll make you more of an imbecile
than your emperor."</p>

<p>"You kill us, we die mouths shut."</p>

<p>"We, we ... Wait before you talk in
the plural; wait till I put this red-hot
shovel to Stolz's ear, and then ..."</p>

<p>Ciampanella came closer to the Croat,
armed with his other heated iron, but suddenly
he felt a blow on his eye which half
blinded him.</p>

<p>"...they can..."</p>

<p>He couldn't finish because Pinocchio burst
out laughing so wildly that he had to hold
his stomach. Ciampanella, who had been
taken unaware by the glass of water Pinocchio
had thrown at him, let out all his
anger on him.</p>

<p>"Youngster, look out for yourself. I
won't stand nonsense from you. I owe to
our enemies the respect enjoined by regulations,
but you I can take by the nape
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
of the neck and set you down on the stove,
and I'll roast you as if you were beef."</p>

<p>Pinocchio became suddenly serious and
began to swing his wooden leg so nervously
that if Major Cutemup had seen him he
would have turned as yellow as a Chinaman
with fear. If the descendant of Romulus
and Remus had had the slightest idea
of the kick which menaced him at this moment
he would have grown calm as if by
magic. But Pinocchio, who had seen Franz
and Stolz exchange sly glances and a smile
full of irony, held himself in and, after
scratching his head solemnly, approached
Ciampanella, who was wiping his eye with
his apron, and taking hold affectionately
of his arm, said:</p>

<p>"So you want to roast me on your
stove?"</p>

<p>"As I told you."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it be better to cook something
on it for our supper this evening?"</p>

<p>"This evening's supper? But you know
that this evening I wouldn't light the fire
if the commander-in-chief came in person
to command me to. When the company is
in action I am free to do what I want,
and when I am free to do what I want I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
don't do anything. So if you are hungry
you'll have to eat bread and compressed
meat, and if you don't like it you'll have to
fast."</p>

<p>"Listen, Ciampanella; you reason like
Menenius Agrippa, who was an ancient
Roman able to make things clearer than
modern Romans, but sometimes you get
tangled up in your premises."</p>

<p>"Listen, youngster, don't insult me, because
as sure as Ciampanella is my name
I will wring your neck like a chicken's."</p>

<p>"But I'm not insulting you."</p>

<p>"Then tell me what kind of things are
<i>premises</i>; otherwise ..."</p>

<p>"Otherwise you'll take me and make me
sit on the stove and roast me, won't you?
That proves that the fire is lighted and that
the charcoal is burning for nothing, and so
if, for example, the commander-in-chief
should pay you a visit he would give you
a fortnight's imprisonment for it, because
when the company's in action you are
free to do what you want, but not in the
kitchen, and if you are hungry you must
eat bread and compressed meat or fast."</p>

<p>"Heh, youngster! I didn't light the
stove for culinary purposes, but for strategic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
reasons. It was to make these two beasts
talk."</p>

<p>"But they haven't talked."</p>

<p>"We'll fling them out and let the mad
dogs eat them."</p>

<p>"But if you, instead of heating the shovel
and tongs, had roasted a young pullet and
served it with one of those famous
sauces ..."</p>

<p>"Chicken in the Roman style with potato
puffs ..."</p>

<p>"Just look at Stolz. He's licking his
greased whiskers as if the potatoes were
cooking under his nose."</p>

<p>"Look at Franz gaping."</p>

<p>"They have a dog's hunger, and in order
to make them sing ..."</p>

<p>"You want me to cook a little supper
such as I can cook if I set myself to it, stick
it under their noses, and ... Youngster,
that's a magnificent idea! When I write
my <i>Manual of War Cookery</i> I'll put you
on the frontispiece as the first of kitchen
strategians. Leave things to me and in
half an hour I'll hand you out a couple of
stews that would raise up the dead better
even than Garibaldi's Hymn!"</p>

<p>Pinocchio heaved a sigh. He had won
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
such a battle that, if he had been a German,
would have caused the people to
hammer I don't know how many nails
into his statue. While Ciampanella was
bustling about on all sides, plucking two
young fowls, peeling potatoes, frying lard
and onions, melting butter in a saucepan,
preparing a stew in another, Pinocchio
was striding up and down the kitchen, long
and narrow as a corridor, eying stealthily
the two prisoners, who were beginning to
show signs of a growing restlessness. They
had been fasting for more than twenty-four
hours and their last food had been such a
mess that it might have been requisitioned
from the poultry-yard and the stable.</p>

<p>Ciampanella seemed eager to surpass
himself. He hovered over his pots without
paying any attention to Pinocchio, but
talking in a loud voice as if he wished to
impart a lesson in cookery to half the
world.</p>

<p>"Listen, youngster, when you want to
eat two savory young fowls you must cook
them in the Roman fashion according to
Ciampanella's recipe, which, when it is
written down, will not have its equal in
<i>Urbis et Orbis</i>. I call it the Roman fashion,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
but it might also truly be called the Ostrogothic
fashion ... but that's the way.
Take two young fowls and cut them into
pieces, put a good-sized lump of butter
into a saucepan and a little onion and fry
it a little; dredge the fowls with flour, and
put them to simmer in the butter; when
they are browned put in some tomato paste,
salt and pepper, and let them cook down,
later a grain of nutmeg, cover it and let it
cook.... Do you smell that odor, youngster?
And just think how it will taste!
You'll lick your napkin like that dirty
Croat who ... Ho! ho! look at his
tongue hanging out.... Ho! ho! ho!"</p>

<p>The air was filled with a fragrance so
entrancing that it would have given an
appetite to the mouth of a letter-box; so
imagine how the miserable two felt, who,
after all, were men of flesh and blood and
had no other defect than of having been
born under the Executioner's scepter. Stolz
with his mouth wide open breathed in the
air in deep breaths, tasting it hungrily as
if he could really taste the odor that tickled
his nostrils. Ciampanella stepped in front
of him, and spouted out one of his special
speeches, gesticulating with his fork.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Croat? How do you think
we do it? Franz Joe is worse off than the
least of our Alpine troops, because we are
not reduced to gnawing bones like you
who make war in order to fish, as the proverb
says, in troubled waters. What a
delicious odor, isn't it? But don't stand
there with your mouth open or I'll fill it
with dish-water. Here's some!"</p>

<p>"'Talian pig!" howled Stolz, half strangled
with nausea and disgust, spitting all around.</p>

<p>"If you call me an Italian pig again,
I'll break your head in spite of the respect
they teach us is due the enemy, because
in this world it is tit for tat."</p>

<p>"Listen, Ciampanella," Pinocchio interrupted
at the right moment, "if the
chickens are done we could sit down at the
table and offer a bite to Stolz."</p>

<p>"That's a good idea, youngster."</p>

<p>While the boy was setting the table and
the chef was dishing up the stew, from the
distance came several tremendous rumblings,
which brought a smile to the faces
of the prisoners, who exchanged significant
glances. The sound came from our six-inch
guns that had been dragged with such effort
to the altitude of nine thousand feet and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
arrived the day before by way of the <i>filovia</i>,
which were now opening fire on the enemy's
trenches. If Franz and Stolz had had even
the faintest suspicion of this they would
have changed their
expressions.</p>

<p class="p2">"Dear Ciampanella,
as a cook
you should be put
on the pedestal of
a monument. This
chicken is a masterpiece.
If that imbecile of a
Stolz, instead of standing
there like a dog with
his tongue hanging out,
a foot away from the tail
of a hare, could give a
lick to this drumstick, I
wager he would desert
his emperor and demand
Italian citizenship."</p>

<div class="figleft" >
<img src="images/im_173.jpg" width="187" height="317" alt="A Cook" />
</div>

<p>"For my part, I'd rather give him the
chicken than the citizenship."</p>

<p>"I would as lief have it," Stolz risked
saying, passing his tongue over his whiskers.</p>

<p>"I guess so."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span></p>

<p>"And I'll give you not only a drumstick,
but half a chicken with gravy and a loaf
of bread to go with it, if you'll tell me ..."</p>

<p>"We can't talk; don't want to betray
our country."</p>

<p>"Dear Stolz, you're a fine fellow, but if
you can't talk I can't give you anything to
eat and we are quits. But I haven't asked
you to betray either Croatia, or even
Hungary, if you are afraid of Franz's
hearing you."</p>

<p>"Oh, he speaks only Magyar."</p>

<p>"All the better; then you can tell me
how many Bohemians, Slovaks, Carinthians,
Poles, Germans, and Styrians are intrenched
on Mount X opposite our men....
We'll leave out the Croats, your countrymen
... and, moreover, I'll wager five
soldi of Victor Emanuel against a crown
of your emperor that if they were here
and smelled this odor they wouldn't make
such a to-do about it or talk like lawyers.
But smell this" ... and while he spoke
the rascal of a Pinocchio took in both his
hands the dish with the stew and held it
close to Stolz's nose, who shut his eyes and
heaved a sigh as if he were giving up his
soul to the god of all the Croats.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span></p>

<p>"You 'Talian scoundrel, if you give me
and Franz all we can eat and drink I'll tell
you what you want to know."</p>

<p>"May the saints in Paradise reward you!
If you sing and sing well, look what delicate
morsels I'll give you," cried Ciampanella,
jumping about with delight. He hastened
to fill two plates with delicious food and
two loaves of fresh bread and half of a sharp
old sheep's cheese which would have brought
a dead man to life.</p>

<p>"And now there's nothing more to do
except to untie your hands and to give you
chairs to sit on."</p>

<p>"We have three lines of trenches, fifteen
hundred men ... two batteries placed on
the Donkey's Saddle ... but you have
Alpine troops and we can't get the better
of you. So our colonel had marvelous
plan&mdash;he had huge mine dug and thought
to blow up Alpines to bust them all up.
This morning we attacked on purpose.
When Alpines came face to us, we go all
back to retreat, but they not come to mined
spot and didn't all bust up. But when
Alpines enter first trench which we leave
... bum! 'Talian pigs all dead and Austrian
soldiers shout hurrah for emperor.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
Did you hear little while ago lots of noise?
I knows ... I knows what it was ...
big mine blow up."</p>

<p>"And 'Talian pigs all killed, aren't they?"
yelled the enraged Ciampanella. "And you
think I am going to give you food? Not
by a long shot. See what game I'm going
to play with you. In the mean time pray
to the god of all the Croats that what you
have said may not be true, because if, instead
of making war as real soldiers do,
your side has committed such a despicable
deed, you two shall pay for it, and as truly
as my name is Ciampanella, chef of the
mess, you'll pay for it dearly enough."</p>

<p>And shaking his lion head and jumping
up in the air, waving his arms about violently,
he took up a piece of rope and
bound the prisoners tightly to a pole which
supported the roof of the dugout.</p>

<p>"And now if you can eat these good gifts
of God which I leave under your nose, you'll
do well, I assure you.... Come, Pinocchio,
we must take this news to the officer
commanding our company, because I don't
believe anything wrong has happened yet."</p>

<p>"And the prisoners?"</p>

<p>"They won't escape, I, Ciampanella,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
assure you. They are tied up like two pork
sausages, and, besides, you know what
we'll do? When the door is shut we'll put
up against it one of the bombs that they
make which go off almost without touching
them. I know where some of them are
hidden away. If they should succeed in
loosening the rope and should try to get
away they'll take a ride in the air. And
now we'll wish the gentlemen good appetite
and be off on our own affairs."</p>

<p>Five minutes later Ciampanella and
Pinocchio were running across the snow
through the dusk.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="center b13"><i>How Pinocchio Complained Because He
Was No Longer a Wooden Puppet</i></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span></p>

<p>It was no easy matter for Ciampanella
and Pinocchio to reach their company,
which was intrenched about three miles
away, on a declivity as sharp as a knife-blade,
bordered by jagged precipices. They
could not have held out against artillery
up there, but the position was well chosen
from which to hammer the enemy's first
trench that was built on a little slope two
hundred yards lower down and less than
two miles away. Farther along there
opened up a pass of great strategic importance
which the Austrians apparently
were intending to defend at all costs.
Yet it had seemed strange to Teschisso
that the foe with its numerous exits should
try to attack his Alpine troops in force, all
the more that his first line of defense
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
might be considered as irretrievably lost.
For this reason he had restrained the
impulse of his brave soldiers to fight and
decided to intrench them on the difficult
slope to await a favorable moment for
decisive action. In the mean time he had
been able to hammer the enemy's position
with four large pieces of artillery which he
had placed on a summit above his intrenchment.
When Pinocchio related to him
how, with the aid of the mess-cook, he had
made Franz and Stolz sing, and repeated
the few words which he had heard from
their mouths, he had no longer any doubt
regarding the foe's strange behavior.</p>

<p>"Heavens! Those scoundrels wanted to
blow us up! Luckily I was prudent, but
you'll see what a joke I'll invent to play
on those dogs! Call Corporal Scotimondo."</p>

<p>The most important duties were usually
intrusted to this soldier with a face like a
cab-driver's, with a large blond beard and
full, ruddy cheeks, who at first sight looked
so good-natured. But he was a man of exceptional
energy and extraordinary courage.
Calm and quiet when danger raged, he
could inspire in his comrades a boundless
confidence.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span></p>

<p>"Corporal, from information received
I have learned that we have opposite us
fifteen hundred men."</p>

<p>"All the better."</p>

<p>"And a mined zone."</p>

<p>"That's not so good, not good at all."</p>

<p>"I have determined to attack the foe
from the rear and force him on to the
mined zone. I shall set off with the whole
company, leaving only eight men in the
trench, which they must hold at all costs
and keep up a devilish fire to make the
enemy think we are all here. Do you
understand?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, certainly."</p>

<p>"You will command the squad."</p>

<p>"Thanks, Captain."</p>

<p>"I will leave you also Pinocchio and
Ciampanella, so that there will be ten of
you. Choose the other eight quickly, because
I am going to give immediate orders
to depart."</p>

<p>"Draghetta, Senzaterra, Pulin, Cattaruzza,
and the four Scagnol brothers."</p>

<p>"All right! Go and tell them. Remember
that I trust you. I am attempting
a big coup, but if I succeed, Heavens, what
a stroke!... They'll fly up like birds."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span></p>

<p>A little later Pinocchio was witness of a
marvelous and fantastic scene. The narrow
trench was alive with a mass of black figures
that moved noiselessly. The Alpine troops
armed themselves with rope and hatchets,
filled up their canteens, and replenished their
cartridge-belts, whispering quick, concise
sentences, interrupted with laughs, quickly
smothered as the rattle of an officer's sword
was heard. All these shadows grouped
themselves in the depth of the trench
against a heap of huge stones and merged
into the profound darkness. For a time
still there was to be heard coming from
down below a subdued rustle, then a profound
silence. Pinocchio was strangely
affected and was eager to find out what
had happened. He ran to the end of the
trench&mdash;there was not a soul there. Where
had his Alpine troops gone? Had they
perhaps been swallowed up by the abyss
which yawned a few feet away? He was
so terrified that he began to yell desperately.</p>

<p>"Captain! Captain Teschis ..."</p>

<p>He didn't get the chance to finish; he
felt two rough, heavy hands grab him by
the ears and lift him up three feet from the
ground.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span></p>

<p>"Less racket here. Don't be such an
idiot. Don't you know that in the trenches
you've got to be as quiet as in church,
and ... here I'm in command, and
when I command anything I've got to
be obeyed."</p>

<p>"I'll obey," Pinocchio grumbled, keeping
back a cry of pain.</p>

<p>Corporal Scotimondo put him down
gently on the ground, face to face with himself,
and then asked, sharply:</p>

<p>"What did you want with Captain
Teschisso?"</p>

<p>"I? Nothing."</p>

<p>"Why did you call him, then?"</p>

<p>"I thought perhaps ... something terrible
had happened.... He's gone ...
they're all gone."</p>

<p>"Gone? How gone? They haven't disappeared;
they've only gone down ..."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"The precipice, and then they'll climb
up again on the other side, will reach the
first trench, will get the better of the enemy
and drive them on the mined zone. Then
we'll see a fine sight. But until this
minute comes we've got to keep quiet and
not make a racket. Do you understand?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
Now go to sleep because you have been
mobilized and will have to stand sentry
also, and, besides, to-morrow there'll be
things to do. Now march!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/im_183.jpg" width="400" height="363" alt="The Cook" />
</div>

<p>Scotimondo emphasized this command
with a kick which made Pinocchio take the
first steps and showed him the direction he
was to go. The unexpected disappearance
of the Alpine troops still seemed miraculous
in spite of the simple explanation Scotimondo
had given him, and Pinocchio had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
a profound respect for everything that
smacked of magic.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/im_184.jpg" width="365" height="250" alt="A Kick" />
</div>

<p>"Yes, gone down," he grumbled to himself
while he was nearing the other end of
the trench. "That's quickly said, but
I'd just like to know how it is possible for
men of skin and bones to do such a thing.
The precipice is so deep and so steep that if
Ciampanella had not pulled me by the collar
I should never have got here. And how
will they manage to get down it? Hum!
I am almost beginning to believe that these
Alpine soldiers are in league with the devil.
I saw two of them yesterday with some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
kind of shoes a couple of yards long which
flew over the snow like airplanes. I
wanted to ask the mess-cook to explain it
to me, but from fear he would make fun of
me I kept quiet. But from now on I must
keep my eyes more on those men. If I
discover they really have any dealings with
the devil I'll take myself off on the first
occasion."</p>

<p>He stumbled and fell face downward
into a soft warm mass from which came a
dull grunt. Overcome with terror, he was
about to take flight when he felt himself
held fast by a leg as firmly as if by a trap.</p>

<p>"I wish you'd get killed. Couldn't you
let me sleep a minute? You must be
either a creditor or that tyrant of a picket
officer going his rounds.... If you are a
creditor come back six months after peace
is declared, because now I won't pay you
a soldo even if I had one. If you are the
picket officer I tell you that when I have
put out the fires I have a right to take my
ease ... and now let me sleep ... May
you be ..."</p>

<p>"Oh, Ciampanella, let me go. Don't
you recognize me? I am Pinocchio."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's you, youngster, is it? Did you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
intend to make me sing like Spizzete Spazzete?
I have nothing to tell you, but if you
insist upon my singing something for you at
all costs, I will sing for you to get up off me."</p>

<p>Pinocchio, seeing that the mess-cook
was in one of his "moments," thought it
prudent to leave him in peace, so he lay
down on a heap of straw that was close by,
intending to go to sleep.</p>

<p>But his sleep didn't last long. About
four o'clock in the morning, when dawn
was peeping over the horizon, he heard a
shot that seemed to come from a spot not
far from the trench.</p>

<p>"Get your guns, boys!" yelled Scotimondo,
rushing to a machine-gun, while
the others, guns in hand, took their places
before the loopholes. "It was Draghetta
who saw the enemy. Boys, I count on you.
We've got to make a racket, lots of noise
as if all the company were here, and don't
expose yourselves ... let them have a
continuous and intense fire."</p>

<p>His glance took in Pinocchio, who was
gazing at him, his eyes wide open with
terror, and Ciampanella tranquilly dozing.
With a bound he caught up a gun and put it
into the boy's hands.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span></p>

<p>"Ho, lad, stop standing there doing nothing
or I'll break your neck! I'll smash your
head before the potato-eaters knock it in."</p>

<p>With another spring he was on top of the
cook, who was calmly dreaming a culinary
dream, and gave him such a kick that he
jumped up like a jack-in-the-box.</p>

<p>"I hope they'll eat you."</p>

<p>"Ready to fire! Fire! for Heaven's sake!"
Scotimondo screamed at him and ran to
take his post, grumbling, "but why doesn't
the sentinel come back? What's that scoundrel
of a Draghetta doing?"</p>

<p>Ciampanella rubbed his eyes and discovered
Pinocchio, who stood there turning
his gun round and round without having yet
discovered what exactly it was that he held.</p>

<p>"May the dogs eat you! Instead of
standing there fiddling with your weapon
that you know as much about as I know
about training fleas, you would do better to
give a look at the saucepan that it doesn't
burn instead of making me get that kick
from the corporal."</p>

<p>"But what saucepan? Are you still
asleep?"</p>

<p>"Didn't you hear what he yelled at me
when he kicked me? 'Fire! Fire!'"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span></p>

<p>"Certainly, but he meant the fire of the
battery, not that of the stove. Don't you
know that we are expecting an attack?"</p>

<p>"Who says so? There's no need to wait
for it. You can wait if you want to, but
I'm off. I don't know anything about war
and don't know how to shoot. When there
are necks to wring or beasts to butcher I'm
ready, because they are hens or lambs or
such like beasts, but Christians I <i>can't</i>,
and toward the enemy I have the respect
ordered by our superiors. Listen, youngster,
if two bullets hit me in the rear I'll
take them and won't protest, but I don't
stay here at the front unless they tie me."</p>

<p>He was just getting away when Scotimondo,
who had an eye on him, turned
hurriedly and poked a revolver at his back.</p>

<p>"Oh, very well! There are certain arguments
you can't dispute. I'll remain, but
I'll find me a hole where I can be safe,
because if I die the <i>Manual of War Cookery</i>
won't be written," and he threw himself
down on a big stone, signaling to the
"youngster" to follow him.</p>

<p>A voice outside was calling for help, only
a few feet away from the trench.</p>

<p>"Stay where you are, all of you. I'll go,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
commanded Scotimondo, and, wriggling like
a serpent, with his revolver in his hand,
he set off and was lost in the darkness.
Shortly after he returned, dragging in
Draghetta.</p>

<p>"What's the matter? Are you wounded?"</p>

<p>"No, not exactly wounded, but I can't
stand up. I'm afraid my feet are frozen."</p>

<p>"Let's have a look," and he made him
sit down and began to free him from his
woolen puttees, his hobnailed boots, his
waterproof stockings, and to rub his red,
swollen feet with snow, all the time continuing
to question him.</p>

<p>"Was it you who fired that shot?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Is the enemy in sight?"</p>

<p>"They tried to leave their trenches&mdash;two
little groups&mdash;one of their usual nasty little
ways to draw us out, and as my superiors
did not see them, I thought it my duty to
give the alarm signal."</p>

<p>"You were right."</p>

<p>"But I wasn't able to get back because
my legs gave way, so I had to try to crawl
on my hands and knees until I had only
breath enough left to call for help, certain
and sure that ..."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span></p>

<p>"Heavens! Swine!" Scotimondo swore
and stopped rubbing.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, nothing; take your place at
the machine-gun; I'll take mine in the
trench."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"You have need of rest," and he went off,
growling, "poor Draghetta! He tried to
warn the rest of us and couldn't get away
himself."</p>

<p>He again left the trench to reconnoiter.
Half an hour later he returned, assembled
his men, and told them that the foe had
retreated to their trenches, but that as
soon as it was lighter they would have to
make themselves heard, so as to keep the
enemy from attempting an attack, which
would undoubtedly be fatal to the little
garrison. They would have to make a
lot of noise, but must not waste ammunition,
because when Captain Teschisso's
company came into action they would probably
have to support it.</p>

<p>"And I impress upon you the importance
of not exposing yourselves. <i>The first who
does so I'll send to the devil myself.</i> I have
need of every one of you, and it's too much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
that out of ten one should be without feet,
one a cook, and <i>one who isn't even a man</i>."</p>

<p>"Did you hear that, youngster?" Ciampanella
asked Pinocchio, when the laugh
which followed Scotimondo's words had
died down. "Did you hear? They want
to send you to the firing-line. What do you
think of that?"</p>

<p>But Pinocchio didn't reply. His wooden
leg just then seemed to have nervous
twinges and rattled like a rusty key in a
lock. The sun had scarcely begun to rise
above the horizon and the snow to glisten
in its rays when from the trench cut out of
the slope narrow as a knife-blade came a
sound of firing that was truly infernal.
The machine-gun was smoking, but poor
Draghetta didn't let it rest a minute. The
others kept up a tremendous fire and an
accurate one, because they could see that
the parapet of the enemy's trench was
marked by little red clouds. Every now
and then above the crackle of the musketry
resounded the humming of larger projectiles
that had their own special tone.
The Austrian commanders were evidently
laying plans for the whole day because
there was not even the shadow of an enemy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
to be seen. They contented themselves
with replying with an occasional shell.
But what would they have done if they had
known that opposite them were only seven
men, and one of them disabled, and that
the formidable <i>ta-pum, ta-pum, ta-pum</i>
which rose above the whine of the musketry
came from&mdash;the <i>mouths</i> of Pinocchio and
Ciampanella?</p>

<p>The coming of the twilight cast a veil of
melancholy over the little garrison, wearied
by the fatigues imposed by its continual
vigilance and the continual answer to the
firing of the foe.</p>

<p>They were all expecting every moment
to see Captain Teschisso's company come
into action, the Austrians swept from their
trenches with the bayonets at their backs
and thrown on the mined zone where they
would all be blown up. Yet nothing of the
sort was taking place. The enemy had
never appeared more quiet and as sure of
himself as to-day. What had happened
to the company? It wasn't possible that it
had been captured by superior forces.
The Alpine troops would have fought like
lions; the noise of their battle would have
reached the trench, and some one would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
certainly have returned to bring the news
of the disaster. It was more likely that
Captain Teschisso, knowing that he would
have to engage a superior force, had decided
to attack at night. The surprise and the
impossibility of judging the number of the
assaulting force would certainly keep the
enemy from resisting. But Corporal Scotimondo
was not altogether satisfied with his
captain's tactics.</p>

<p>"I'm not a Napoleon," he grumbled, in
his patois, striding with long steps through
the narrow passageway of the trenches,
every now and then making a right-about
face. "I'm not a Napoleon. It's easy to
say 'hold fast at all costs,' but in order to
hold fast you have to have men. My men
are not made of iron; I am not made of
iron; they need rest and yet even to let
them rest I can't allow the trench to be
without sentinels all night. If I change
sentries every half-hour, nobody sleeps; if
I make them stay at the posts for two hours
according to regulations, they'll come back
to me with their feet frozen like Draghetta,
and then we couldn't hold fast. Plague
take it! This is certainly a situation to
upset a corporal. If ..."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span></p>

<p>He stopped suddenly because Pinocchio
barred his way. He looked at him for a
minute in amazement, gestured with his
head for him to move to one side, but, seeing
that he stood there as firmly as if he had
taken root, he grunted, I don't know
whether with anger or surprise.</p>

<p>"Skip, boy, skip. Don't you understand
anything? Don't you understand I want
you to get from under my feet?"</p>

<p>"Just a question, corporal."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"You need a sentinel for to-night."</p>

<p>"Yes, a new one every half-hour."</p>

<p>"I have come to volunteer."</p>

<p>"Why not? I like the idea ... you,
too, will take your half-hour's turn, but
this doesn't help me solve my problem
of ..."</p>

<p>"But I have come to volunteer for the
whole night."</p>

<p>"Really? Are you in earnest?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed. You see, Corporal Squassamondo,
I should have liked to remind you
this morning early that I have a wooden
leg, but I prefer to tell you now. Wood
doesn't freeze and so I can stand guard
for ten hours even without any danger, if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
you only give me enough to cover myself
with and plenty to eat."</p>

<p>"And the other leg?"</p>

<p>"Ciampanella has told me that storks
sleep all night standing on one leg and
don't fall over. I am a man 'that's not a
man,' but if I were no more good than a
stork I shouldn't have got a wooden leg
on the battle-field."</p>

<p>The little lesson had sunk in and Scotimondo
felt it like a pinch on the shins.
He tried to be furious, but didn't succeed.
He let out a terrible "Good Heavens!"
then was overcome with emotion, caught
Pinocchio in his arms, pressed him to himself,
and kissed him again and again.</p>

<p class="p2">It was a night blacker than a German
conscience. Two shadows glided over the
snow and stopped in the shelter of a rock
which dominated all the narrow slope, the
enemy's trenches, the awful mass of peaks
and jagged ridges. At the side of the
adversary's position the snow was marked
with an enormous black streak which was
lost in the depth of the mountains. It was
the abyss, a frightful wedge-shaped crack
which looked like an enormous interrogation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
point drawn with charcoal on an
immense white sheet.</p>

<p>"You feel all right?"</p>

<p>"Fine as possible."</p>

<p>"Did they give you a good supper?"</p>

<p>"I'm so full that I can't draw a long
breath with all this stuff I've got on me.
I certainly sha'n't feel cold."</p>

<p>"In your right pocket you'll find a thermos
bottle of hot coffee; in the other, chocolate."</p>

<p>"Splendid."</p>

<p>"Do you want a gun?"</p>

<p>"What should I do with it? In case of
alarm I'll keep sounding '<i>ta-pum</i>' like this
morning."</p>

<p>"Then you understand. You must keep
a lookout down there all the time, there
where the white of the snow meets the
black of the sky. If you see anything white
on black or black on white which moves
give the alarm; if not, keep still. Take
good care not to fall asleep, because if I
should go the rounds and find you asleep
I should be compelled to kill you at your
post."</p>

<p>"In that case wake me up ... five
minutes beforehand."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm off."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span></p>

<p>"Good luck."</p>

<p>"I want to impress it on you&mdash;no racket
now."</p>

<p>"Good-by, Scrollamondo. Don't worry."</p>

<p class="p2">Pinocchio had the courage of a lion that
night, and if the Austrians had attempted
an attack he would have felt equal to them
all by himself. As soon as he was alone
he took out from the pockets of his cloak,
so full of food that they seemed a military
depot, a thin rope a couple of yards long,
knotted one end of it, stuck his head
through, bending his good leg, put his foot
on the rope, which he swung in front of him
at the height of his knee, and, leaning
against the rock, stood there still, resting
on his wooden leg.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/im_198.jpg" width="378" height="283" alt="Dark" />
</div>

<p>"And now I am ready," he muttered,
contentedly; "now let them come on. I'm
not afraid of any one, not even of the snow.
There's no denying it&mdash;my idea was magnificent.
If that simpleton Toni Salandra
had had one as good he would have saved
the Ministry. Two feet of rope and the
trench is saved. With two soldi's worth
of soap he could have saved the finest
Parliament our poor country has ever seen....
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
It's queer that I haven't the slightest
sensation of fear.... It's dark, but I
seem to see as well as by day. It must be
that a sentinel's duty clears the sight. I
could swear that I could see a flea a mile
away. Besides, my duty is simple: I am
to stay here and do nothing; I am not to
get my feet frozen, and as far as that is concerned
there's no danger; and I am to look
out for white moving on black or black on
white. Then, <i>ta-pum</i>, <i>ta-pum</i>, <i>ta-pum</i>, like
this morning, then throw myself on the
ground and creep back to the trench like a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
cat.... What a fire we kept up this
morning, I and Ciampanella! He fired so
often and so vigorously that he ended by
falling over with fright.... If he hadn't
had to sleep off his fatigue I couldn't have
done the fine deed I'm doing. I am sure
he wouldn't have let me get cold like this
... because ... I didn't feel it at first, but
now I feel chills creeping up my spine!"</p>

<p>When Pinocchio stuck his hand into his
pocket it touched the rounded form of the
thermos bottle. He took it out, put it to his
lips, and drank a mouthful. Five minutes
later the boy felt the heat mounting to his
brain as if he were at the mouth of a furnace.</p>

<p>"Ah-ha! That's good! When I am a
general like Win-the-War I'll heat the railway
compartment with coffee instead of
with a radiator. I wish they'd 'murder'
the garments I got on, as Ciampanella
says: When I think that he made me
run the risk of having eight bullets in my
stomach I don't know what to do. But
before I would have him burned up, it
would be nice to sleep here under this
upholstered seat, with the lullaby of the
train that sounds as if my nurse were singing
it. If he found me now I should like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
to drop into one of those dozes from which
even Ciampanella's <i>ta-pum</i> wouldn't wake
me.... If I go to sleep I'll be cold.
That tyrant of a Scotimondo would just
as lief wake me up with a revolver at my
head.... I'd like to know what's the
fun of keeping a poor sentinel out in the
cold where there's nothing to watch, because
I bet a soldo against a lira that the
Austrians are sleeping soundly to-night&mdash;I
seem to hear them snoring like so many
suckling pigs.... No, I said I wouldn't
go to sleep, and to keep my word I won't go
to sleep, but I can allow myself a nod, just
a little nod. There's no black on white,
or white on black; it seems to me to be
getting more cloudy ... so that ... Scotimondo?
But what is it? I am no Napoleon
... he said it. But even Napoleon when
he found a sleeping sentinel took his gun
and waited till he waked up. He would do
the same ... with the difference that I
haven't any gun ... so that ... not so
much noise ... Scotimon ...? but where
is Scotmona ... Scoti ... mon ... do..."</p>

<p class="p2">Just at this moment the snow began to
fall gently, so gently, and as dry as flour
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
just from the mill. The corporal, who was
about to set out on his usual tour of inspection,
glanced at the sky, then growled,
as he rubbed his hands: "The Austrians
won't come out in such weather. It will
be a foot thick in less than an hour. I'll
go and sleep, myself."</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/im_202.jpg" width="345" height="218" alt="An Explosion" />
</div>
<p class="p2">Pinocchio woke up with a start. It was
dawn!... He found himself buried in
the snow up to his chest. He looked
about and could no longer see the enemy's
trench; he looked behind him and couldn't
recognize the Italian post. What under
the heavens had happened? He was on
the point of becoming despondent and ready
to give the alarm when on the side of the
enemy's position in the wide wedge-sloped
cleft, which looked like an exclamation
point drawn with charcoal on an immense
white sheet, he thought he saw a curious
movement like many ants. He fixed his
eyes on it, and while his heart beat so
loudly that he thought he would suffocate,
he concentrated all his attention, all his
mind, on the point there below. He saw
the jagged rock swarming with Alpine
troops, saw little clusters of men suspended
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
over the abyss, and ropes hanging in space
slowly lifting up soldiers; and at the sight
of this miracle of daring and dexterity he
naturally forgot the fear of his wakening.
Anxiously he followed the maneuvers of
these brave sons of Italy, saw them suddenly
disappear.... Then a cry of terror
rose from the enemy's trench, a rattle of
guns and almost at the same moment two or
three hundred Austrians were in flight and
flinging themselves on the slope, pursued
by a steady fire. It was time to give the
alarm. Pinocchio wanted to let out one
of his extraordinary <i>ta-pums</i>, but just then
a terrible explosion shook the earth and
clouded the sky.... A horrible yell, a cry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
from hundreds of throats struck him to the
marrow ... then there was silence.</p>

<p>Captain Teschisso, returning victorious
from his expedition, found Pinocchio there,
and tenderly gave him first aid, but, seeing
that he didn't come to, he intrusted him
to four soldiers, saying:</p>

<p>"Take him to the first ambulance, with
Draghetta and the other wounded, and
tell the surgeon to care for him as my best
friend. Poor youngster, who will have to
have another wooden leg! But we have
avenged him and given those dogs what
they deserved. Heavens, what a fight!"
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="center b13"><i>Many Deeds and Few Words</i></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span></p>

<p>My dear little friends, I won't stop to
show you Pinocchio in the sad surroundings
of a hospital. I will tell you only
that he stayed there for more than two
months, and that he left it with his two
wooden legs, new and well oiled, and that
Fatina, by a curious coincidence, was his
careful and affectionate nurse, and that
Ciampanella, playing the part of a good
friend, did not fail to make him frequent
visits, bringing with him certain samples
of camp cookery which enraptured Pinocchio.
His surgeon was a most polite Piedmontese,
always bowing and salaaming,
who announced to him with all formality
the misfortune which had again overtaken
him and asked his permission two days in
advance to amputate his frozen leg.</p>

<p>"All right," exclaimed Pinocchio, "go
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
ahead. I've got accustomed to such trifles
now. But you must do me a favor."</p>

<p>"Let me hear it."</p>

<p>"When you give me my new wooden leg
I want it to be longer than usual and that
naturally you change the other one, too."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because I'd feel as if I were on stilts and
it would amuse me to death to take steps
longer than any one else."</p>

<p>He was satisfied and left the hospital
with such long legs that he was almost as
tall as Ciampanella, who took Pinocchio's
arm in his as if he were his sweetheart.</p>

<p>"Heh, youngster, but you have grown!
And then they say that we non-combatants
never do anything! I haven't done anything,
but if I were the one I have in mind
I would bestow on you the medal for
bravery because your legs have won it. I
tell you, I, who know what I am talking
about."</p>

<p>"Even if they don't give me anything, I
am satisfied all the same. All I ask is
for them to leave me here and not send me
home."</p>

<p>"Come with me and I'll appoint you first
adjutant of the mess kitchen, and when I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
have taught you how and put the ladle
in your hand <i>we will live on the fat of the land</i>
and will make meat-balls with our leavings
for the general, and when we don't know
what else to do we'll write the <i>Manual of
War Cookery</i>, which I won't risk now
because I haven't a writing hand, as the
saying is."</p>

<p>"Listen, Ciampanella, I am as grateful as
if you had offered to lend me a hundred
lire without interest, but just now I can't
accept."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because it requires a special constitution
to be a cook. I'd be all right as far
as eating the best morsels was concerned,
but it would be dangerous for me to stay
near the stove. I am half wooden and run
the risk of catching on fire. I should have
to decide to take out insurance against fire.
Moreover, let's consider. To-day I have
other views. Fatina here has given me a
letter for my friend Bersaglierino, who is
at headquarters as the war correspondent
of an important newspaper. We'll see
what he advises me to do."</p>

<p>They parted good friends after a solemn
feast which almost made Ciampanella roll
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
under the table, like an ancient Roman at
one of the banquets of Lucullus or Nero.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/im_207.jpg" width="348" height="249" alt="At Table with Bersaglierino" />
</div>

<p>Bersaglierino was truly delighted to see
his dear little friend again and kept him
with him several days for company. From
him he learned a number of things he didn't
know. One day he asked him:</p>

<p>"Tell me, Pinocchio, do you know the
reason for this war in which you, too, have
played your small part and to which you
have paid tribute of part of yourself?"</p>

<p>"Do you imagine I don't know? It is
<i>to make Italy bigger</i>."</p>

<p>"And that seems a just reason to you?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span></p>

<p>"That's what every one says."</p>

<p>"All those who don't know what they
are talking about. If every nation had
the right to let loose a war for the sole
purpose of enlarging her boundaries we'd
have to take off our hats to the Germans
who provoked the present curse for their
own purposes. We have other and nobler
ideals. We have brothers to liberate, peoples
to free from a foreign yoke. Certain
lands which are ours because they were
enriched by the labors of our fathers,
because our Italian tongue is spoken in
them, were until to-day exploited by the
enemy, who sought in every way to embitter
the existence of our brothers, paying with
contempt and scorn, with persecution and
oppression, their loyalty and love for the
mother-country. Italian unity, begun in
the revolutionary movement of 1811, was
not completed in 1870 with the taking of
Rome. The jealousy of other nations
halted us on our way to emancipation. We
were too weak then to make our will felt;
we were exhausted with fifty years of continuous
fighting and we had need of a little
rest in order to restore our energy. To-day
we are strong enough to stand up for our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
rights. Neither underhand dealings of
wicked men nor betrayal by partizans will
prevent the victory of our arms. Italy will
be retempered in the war. Our destiny will
be fulfilled.</p>

<p>"I see as in a dream our borders which
have been overrun won back to us, Trent
bleeding with Italian blood, Goriza twice
redeemed, Trieste in the shadow of the
tricolor. Istria awaits us impatiently; Parenzo
is preparing the way for us to Pola,
which we shall take intact, with the defenses
the Austrians erected there against
our own brothers. Zara, Sebenico, and the
coast of Dalmatia, which for so many centuries
displayed the glorious insignia of the
Lion of St. Mark, are longing impatiently
for the moment which shall reunite them to
the mother-country, that for them and with
them will grow ever greater. War is a
curse; this one which is being fought to-day
all over the civilized world is perhaps the
most terrible which humanity has ever
known; yet it will not fail to bring great
blessings. It has awakened the consciences
of peoples and revealed the virtues and the
defects of particular races. In the contest
of the ancient Latin civilization with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
Teuton power the might of right has been
re-established, the right that has been
trampled upon by force...."</p>

<p>And so on and so on, for when Bersaglierino
began to argue there was no way of
stopping him, and Pinocchio stood there
listening with his mouth open like a peasant
absorbed by the wonderful discourse of a
fakir at a fair. And who knows how long
he would have stood there, but Bersaglierino
had so much to do and was obliged
to leave him alone, letting him stay in
the rear where he could follow the progress
of the war without exposing himself too
much, but where he could still be doing
important service for his country. He put
him in the care of a captain of the commissary
department, a good friend of his
who had the unlucky idea of making him a
baker in a camp bakery. He stayed there
only two days, astounded at the enormous
quantity of bread which was kneaded and
baked all the time. All he did was to give
a hand in filling the baskets which were
loaded on automobiles that carried the
bread to the front. The third day he made
a figure of dough that looked like the twin
brother of the captain, put it in the oven
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
and, when it was baked, set it astraddle
on the cup of coffee poured out for that
officer, then hid himself behind a curtain
to take part in the welcome which would
certainly be given to his most valuable
work of art. But the commissary officer's
orderly found him and wanted to dust his
trousers and pull his ears. He never succeeded
in doing this. Pinocchio helped
him out of the house with kicks and then
hurled him into the flour-barrel. If they
had not pulled him out in time he would
have suffocated.</p>

<p>The boy fled on the first automobile which
left for the front, and for several days
whirled back and forth between the front
and rear lines, going forward on the supply
automobiles and returning on the Red Cross
ambulances which brought the wounded
to the first-aid posts. The drivers were
glad to take him on their machines because
he kept them all jolly with his pranks, and
he, better than any one, was able to get
an idea of the gigantic and wonderful work
which was being done side by side with the
army which was fighting for the defense
of its country. What profound respect
for discipline, what order, what spirit of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
self-sacrifice in those brave soldiers (almost
all fathers of families), continually exposed
to bad weather, to the hardest fatigues,
to the most complete privations! Rain,
snow, ice, tornadoes of wind and of shot
and shell, nothing succeeded in interrupting
for a single minute the interminably long
chain of wagons and lorries that carried
food to the trenches, ammunition to the
artillery, and cannon to the fortified positions.
The drivers, dead with sleep, soaked
with rain, shivering with cold, remained
calmly at their wheels and at the heads of
their horses. When the great caravan
stopped for a moment for any reason these
men, revived with new energy and by the
force of their will, started the huge mechanism
on its way again.</p>

<p>For a little way Pinocchio thought he
would become an automobile-driver, but
when they told him that he would have to
have a license and that, in order to get one,
he would have to take a regular examination,
he didn't proceed farther. Examiners
he looked upon as even greater enemies
than Franz Joe's hunters.</p>

</div>

<p>After pondering the subject a long time
he decided to become a military postman.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
At first he took pleasure in it all. When
he arrived it seemed as if heaven had come
down to earth. He was received like a
king, with joyous cries and shouts, and he
walked between two rows of soldiers like a
general. When he distributed the letters
it was as if he conferred a favor; when he
handed out a money-order he had an air
of condescension as if he were doling the
soldi from his purse. When he had finished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
distributing the mail he would let
them pay him to read their letters. I can
tell you it was not an easy matter. Often
he had hieroglyphics to decipher which
would have given trouble to a professor of
paleontology. But Pinocchio had such a
quick mind that when he found he couldn't
puzzle it out he invented a letter and
did it so well that he earned a soldo by
it and the deep gratitude of his clients.
What disgusted him with the business was
the postal service, which suddenly became
confoundedly bad, perhaps on account of a
change in the Ministry. Pinocchio saw his
popularity vanish in an instant, and the
soldiers made him bear the brunt of their
dissatisfaction. One day he heard so many
complaints that he grew furious and flung
away the bag he wore about his neck and
cried out to those who were disputing
around him:</p>

<p>"You are a bunch of imbeciles. Why
do you come to me with your letters? Do
you know what you ought to do? Go and
get them, because I won't take another
step for the sake of your pretty faces."</p>

<p>His ears were boxed again and again and
he replied with as many kicks, but he didn't
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
play postman any more. He was wondering
to what new service he could dedicate
himself when a corporal baker gave him this
note:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Pinocchio</span>,&mdash;I am having the one who will
hand you this write these lines so that he can tell
you for me that I have a great longing to see you,
because I am not well and I don't know what to do,
and I sign myself your most affectionate</p>

<p class="left65"><span class="smcap">Ciampanella</span>,<br />
<span class="o6"><i>Chief Mess-cook in the service of the</i></span><br />
<span class="o4"><i>Commander-in-chief</i>.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Pinocchio was so affected by this letter
that he set off at once in search of his friend.
He found him in full performance of his
noble functions, white, red, and flourishing
as if he had come back the day before from
taking the cure at Montecatini.</p>

<p>"Well?" he said in astonishment, after
they had embraced.</p>

<p>"Well, youngster, I am here and I am
not here in this beastly world."</p>

<p>"But, truly ..."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't say that I am on the
downward path, to make use of the words
of the chaplain, but Ciampanella is no
longer himself. They have given me only
a few months more to live. I don't mind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
for myself, you know. I think that I shall
be as well off there as I have been here....
But I am thinking of humanity."</p>

<p>"Nothing and a little less than nothing."</p>

<p>"No joking now, youngster. Without
the <i>Manual of War Cookery</i> written by
Ciampanella humanity can never be happy,
because with it men will eat and laugh,
and when you laugh you spend willingly,
and when you spend willingly you eat well....
So that ..."</p>

<p>"Why don't you write it?"</p>

<p>"First of all, because I lack the knowledge
of handwriting, which you've got to do;
that is why I sent for you, and then ...
because I am afraid that I won't have
time enough to dictate it all, because the
surgeon-major who examined me said that I
had a disease of the liver from eating too
much, and that it would be the liver that
would bring me to my grave if I didn't stop
immediately living on the fat of the land
and drink quantities of water. Listen,
youngster, I have always had a great antipathy
for liver, so much so that I never even
put it in patties called Strasburg and which
in my <i>Manual</i> I will rechristen 'Austro-German
Trenches with Reinforcements of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
War Bread and Ambushed in Jelly.' But
that's not the point. As I tell you, I have
always had a great antipathy to liver, but
also for water, so much so, I'll tell you in
confidence, that sometimes I don't even use
it to wash my face in.</p>

<p>"So listen. Since they have brought me
to this crossroads&mdash;either drink water and
live or eat good things and let my liver take
me to the next world&mdash;I have decided on the
latter. Before dying I wanted to call you
to my presence to tell you that as I have no
one in the world I have been thinking of
leaving you everything I possess: ten
ladles, a carver, the change-purse, and the
recipes for the <i>Manual</i>, for which, when you
publish it, they will give you at least the
cross of a knight, that when you put it on
will make, you feel 'way and ahead of those
who look at you."</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/im_218.jpg" width="342" height="356" alt="Saucepan Boiling Over" />
</div>

<p>In short, Ciampanella said so much and
did so much that he persuaded Pinocchio
to stay with him. And certainly the boy
could not find a better way of making
himself useful to his country. The mess-cook
was at the orders of a division.
Each day he satisfied the hunger of four
generals, six colonels, and a crowd of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
majors and captains of the General Staff.
All these were men who had need of good
eating that wouldn't cause indigestion.
Pinocchio served ... as director of the
mess. When he saw some saucepan boiling
over, a pot too full, he quickly reduced
them by tasting their contents generously.
Sauces and ragoûts were his passion. Every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
now and then you might have seen him
dipping half a loaf of bread into the casseroles.
One day a captain who was inspecting
surprised him at this, and naturally
he lit into Ciampanella about it, who
threatened to quit the kitchen if they didn't
leave him in peace.</p>

<p>"Do you understand, Mr. Captain? Do
you imagine that standing over a fire is
a great pleasure? I am beginning to
believe that it is better to stay in the
trenches and die <i>with a ball in the head</i>
than in the rear when you come and ruin
my comfort with your inspections. But
do you know what I'll do? I'll hide the
ladles in a place I know of and I'll take
up a musket and you'll see what you'll see."</p>

<p>The captain had to slink off, speeded by
the laughs of Pinocchio, whose nose was
smeared and greasy and his mouth dripping
with tomato sauce. Ciampanella, who was
so lacking in respect to his superiors, obeyed
the boy as if he were a head taller than he.
Pinocchio had persuaded him to drink quarts
of water and to take digestive tablets after
his meals, and every morning a spoonful
of salts in a glass of water as the surgeon-major
had ordered. And he followed out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
this prescription so carefully that he had
noticed a wonderful improvement, and he
kept a big bottle full of medicine among
his cans of pepper and spices. This fact
had several times started an idea in Pinocchio's
whimsical pate, and several times
he had been on the point of exchanging
this medicine for the kitchen salt, but the
thought of the serious consequences which
might result had kept him from doing it.
Moreover, Pinocchio was called more and
more often to serve the mess-table and
spent less time in the kitchen. The famous
captain of the inspection had thought in
this way to avenge himself upon that most
insolent of semi-puppets, but, to tell you
the truth, he didn't find it bad. Serving
at table so many grand generals seemed
to him almost an honor, and he was proud
of it. When he handed the dishes to the
highest officers he would make low bows;
the captains he treated almost with disdain.
He always tried to serve his "particular"
captain the last, and when there was left
in the dish scarcely enough to scrape out
another portion he would whisper in his ear:</p>

<p>"Heh, Captain, blessed are those that
are last!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span></p>

<p>The captain fumed, but waited for the
moment when he could give him a reprimand.
He thought the time had come one
morning when he found a fly in the stew.</p>

<p>"Come here, you little beast."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; at your orders, sir."</p>

<p>"Look!" and he stuck the plate of stew
two inches from his nose.</p>

<p>"There is no doubt, Captain, that it is
a fly, a very vulgar fly," and sticking two
fingers delicately into the sauce he pulled
the insect out ... "a fly indeed! But
you may consider yourself lucky because
in the rations of your men there will be at
least twenty of them. And those who
fight don't think much of it. You do the
same, Captain ... in war-time don't bother
about such trifles."</p>

<p>A tank commander who was next to him
laughed heartily. The captain, as green
as a newly formed tomato, kept quiet and
ate the stew.</p>

<p class="p2">That day there was a grand dinner for
some French and British officers who had
come on a mission to the front. Ciampanella
had cooked one of his wonderful
recipes. Pinocchio, who had stuck his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
nose and tongue into all the pots and pans,
swore that even the King's cook was not
equal to producing such a dinner. And
he, too, wished to do himself honor. He
set the table in a grassy spot surrounded by
high trees and thick hedges. It wasn't
possible to find a more picturesque spot,
shady and safe from curious eyes, from
reporters, and&mdash;spies. It was a little distance
from the kitchen, but distances
didn't bother Pinocchio, whose legs, longer
than ordinary ones, could take steps like a
giant's. He decorated the table with wild
flowers and wove between the branches
of the trees the flags of Italy, France, England,
and America, tied together with the
colors of Belgium, dressed himself afresh,
and prepared to display all his good
manners.</p>

<p>All the high officers seated at the table
made a wonderful sight. The uniforms,
starred with crosses and ribbons, shining
with gold and silver, were all the more
sparkling against the green background of
the trees and the meadow.</p>

<p>Pinocchio had served the finest <i>consommé</i>
with the air of a head waiter in an expensive
restaurant. When he returned to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
serve a magnificent capon in jelly shaped
like a cannon surrounded by hearts of
green lettuce which appeared on the menu
under the name "William's Wishes, with
Evasions of German Financiers," he was
struck by a strange sight. All the diners
had fled from the table and were going
hurriedly behind the hedge, overcome with
nausea. A terrible idea flashed through
Pinocchio's mind. He turned around and,
his capon in his hand, rushed to the
kitchen.</p>

<p>"Ciampanella! Ciampanella!"</p>

<p>"What's the matter?"</p>

<p>"The medicine?"</p>

<p>"What's the medicine got to do with
dinner?"</p>

<p>"What did you put in the soup?"</p>

<p>"Are you crazy, youngster? Be quiet
and let the officers eat."</p>

<p>"Ciampanella, are you perfectly sure of
yourself?"</p>

<p>"Why do you ask me if I am sure of
myself?"</p>

<p>"Because ... the officers aren't eating."</p>

<p>"What are they doing?"</p>

<p>"Just come and see, because I don't
understand about cooking."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span></p>

<p>They went running, but had scarcely
passed the threshold when a bomb from an
enemy airplane burst a few feet from them.
They were hit in the chest by a column of
air which turned them round, were hurled
back into the kitchen, and buried beneath
a shower of masonry.</p>

<p class="p2">Ciampanella remained buried there, to
the great misfortune of humanity, who,
after all, had to do without his <i>Manual of
War Cookery</i>, but Pinocchio was dug out
alive. He was carried hastily to the nearest
ambulance station and fell into the hands
of a splendid surgeon, who, after having set
a slender fracture of the arm and of the
breastbone, swore to save him in spite of
fate. He hurriedly amputated an arm,
and a fortnight later in the hospital of a
near-by city they extracted the broken ribs,
for which they substituted two silver plates.</p>

<p>When Fatina and the Bersaglierino hurried
to his bed to help him and cheer him
they found themselves face to face with a
poor creature who, with his artificial legs,
arm, and breast, seemed indeed ... a
wooden puppet.</p>

<p>But Pinocchio was still himself, humorous,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
lively, and mischievous. When he noticed
that Fatina was looking at him with her
big blue eyes full of tears and pity, he
shrugged his shoulders and, scratching his
left ear vigorously, made a face and said:</p>

<p>"Pretty object, heh? But you must be
patient. In order to become a real boy
I couldn't help but go back to ... the
old one!"
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="center b13"><i>And Now&mdash;Finished or Not Finished</i></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span></p>

<p>It was a beautiful morning, sparkling with
sunshine and glory because the tricolor
was waving from the windows of every
house and the people in the streets had
joy in their eyes and a smile on their lips.
On the terrace of a handsome mansion,
a terrace of marble decorated with exotic
plants, at the end of which was a large
stained-glass window, a man of mature age
and military bearing was stretched out in
a reclining-chair. He was smoking a large
meerschaum pipe and blew out such puffs
of smoke that it seemed as if he were trying
to obscure the sun. By his side was a
soldier awaiting orders, and near by was a
stand on which a magnificent green parrot
stood, scratching his head with his claw
and rolling his big yellow eyes.</p>

<p>"Heh! What do you say to that, Duretti?
Are we or are we not great? To-day that
we can say we have made Italy?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Now you see</p>
<p>Italy</p>
<p>The general has made so free ..."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>chattered the wretch of a parrot.</p>

<p>"Be quiet, Coccorito; if you keep on
with that nonsense I won't give you any
sunflower seeds for a week. I'd like to know
who trained him to be so impertinent
during my absence. If it were not ..."</p>

<p>General Win-the-War started to get up,
but a sudden twinge of pain made him
cry out and keep still in his chair. After
biting his lips for five minutes he began
again to suck the mouthpiece of his pipe,
and after smoking up the air for another
five minutes he said:</p>

<p>"Heh! My dear Duretti, it is a great
satisfaction to fight for the greatness of
one's country, and if it were not for that
cursed Austrian shot which broke my leg
I should like ..."</p>

<p>But Coccorito wouldn't let him finish
and began to sing in his horrible voice:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Every day,</p>
<p>Pé&mdash;pé&mdash;pé,</p>
<p>When he grew great,</p>
<p>The soldiers he ate,</p>
<p class="i1">Ho, ho, ho!</p>
<p>He broke his leg,</p>
<p>Or so he said,</p>
<p>'Tis gout, you know,</p>
<p>Won't let him go ..."</p>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/im_228.jpg" width="226" height="362" alt="He Threw His Pipe at the Bird" />
</div>
<p>The general groaned and threw with all
the strength he had left his big meerschaum
pipe at the bird. Coccorito would have
come to a sad end if the god of parrots had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
not, as he always did, held his protecting
hand over his tuft. The pipe grazed his
head and fell in the street, while he, with
a strong tug at his light brass chain, flew
off and perched himself on the window-sill
of the floor above, where he laughed loudly
and cried:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Ha, ha, ha!</p>
<p>The general to the front set out,</p>
<p class="i1">Felt a blow and down he fell,</p>
<p>Because he suffers from the gout.</p>
<p class="i1">He says his leg he broke&mdash;well, well&mdash;</p>
<p>For his King, for Italy</p>
<p>He broke his leg&mdash;he, he, he, he!"</p>
</div></div>

<p>But Coccorito could now sing in peace
and be as insolent as he liked because the
general was no longer paying any attention
to him, for two excellent reasons. First,
because, in spite of his high rank, he was
not great enough to reach up to the second-floor
window; second, and more important,
because at the moment that his pipe fell in
the street a carriage stopped in front of the
house and out of it got a gentleman, a lady,
and ... a small box they were carrying,
and it was against this box that the strange
projectile fell, making such a clatter that
the lady couldn't help uttering a few words
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
of protest. Win-the-War, who never allowed
any one to outdo him in courtesy,
found it necessary to explain matters, and
with the help of his orderly got up from his
chair and dragged himself to the railing
of the terrace.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, I beg you.... You are
right to protest, but my pipe ... fell....
I threw it.... In short, it is all the
fault of my parrot, who upset me and the
pipe. Coccorito, show them at least ...
so that the lady and gentleman may not
believe ..."</p>

<p>"But don't imagine such a thing, General.
Don't bother yourself ... it is no matter."</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Ha, ha, ha!</p>
<p>The general to the front set out,</p>
<p class="i1">Felt a blow and down he fell,</p>
<p>Because he suffers from the gout.</p>
<p class="i1">He says his leg he broke&mdash;well, well&mdash;</p>
<p>For his King, for Italy</p>
<p>He broke his leg&mdash;he, he, he, he!"</p>
</div></div>

<p>Coccorito began again.</p>

<p>"Oh, you wretch! Did you hear him?"</p>

<p>"Don't apologize, General. I beg your
pardon. Does old Geppetto live here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, on the floor above. Ring the
second bell."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you."</p>

<p>"Not at all."</p>

<p>Old Geppetto was getting ready to mend
an old table the legs of which were red with
worm-holes and had in hand a piece of
seasoned wood, a splendid piece. He was
going to cut it with a hatchet and he had
lifted up his hand holding the shining tool,
when who knows what queer thoughts
made his arm fall heavily. Did he perhaps
remember that other famous piece of wood
from which the sprightly little old man
had shaped the wonderful puppet which
had brought him so much bother and
trouble? And what had become of him?
Why had he sent no news of himself since
he had gone out into the world like a real
boy? Perhaps the poor little old man
would have preferred to have him still at
his side, a puppet as he used to be, and of
wood out of which he had made him, than
to be left thus alone in the last years of his
life. He had tried so often to make another
Pinocchio, but he had never been able to
finish his work. His hands trembled; his
eyes were no longer what they used to be,
and even the wood&mdash;certainly it was the truth
about the wood&mdash;wasn't what it used to be.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span></p>

<p>When he heard the bell ring he felt his
heart beat, and he ran to open the door,
swaying from side to side like a drunken
man.</p>

<p>"Who's there?"</p>

<p>"It's I, Geppetto. Don't you recognize
me?"</p>

<p>"My Fatina!"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, your Fatina who has come
to introduce her husband, the Bersaglierino,
to you, and to see how you are, and to
bring you somebody you are fond of, very
fond of," she replied, as they entered.</p>

<p>He gave her a long, questioning glance
from beneath his spectacles; then he
spied Pinocchio mischievously hiding behind
Fatina and the Bersaglierino.</p>

<p>"Oh, Fatina! Fatina! How did they
bring my poor puppet to such a state?"
sobbed Geppetto as he looked at Pinocchio.
"What under the sun is all this machinery
and these contraptions? I made him of
wood, all of wood, and so splendidly that
no one was ever able to imitate him. Why
did you let them abuse him in this way?
Wouldn't it have been better if you had
let him stay a <i>real boy</i> than to bring him
back to me in this condition?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span></p>

<p>And the dear little old man couldn't contain
himself and gave vent to his sorrow
in loud weeping.</p>

<p>Fatina and the Bersaglierino could find
no words to comfort him with and looked
at him compassionately, their own throats
tightening. When Papa Geppetto had
grown a little calmer he took his puppet
in his arms and examined him carefully all
over, shaking his head and drawing his lips
tightly as if he wished to keep his sobs from
bursting out again. He saw the artificial
legs, the arm with its steel spring and the
tweezers for hands; he saw the large silver
plate which supported the breastbone&mdash;admired
all this up-to-date mechanism,
but was not in the least satisfied. The poor
little old man preferred his wooden puppet
<i>all of wood</i> to the marrow ... and he no
longer recognized <i>his</i> old Pinocchio.</p>

<p>"Oh, Fatina!" he said, sighing, "who
brought him to such a state?"</p>

<p>"Our country, dear friend."</p>

<p>"Our country?" and for a moment he
stood there, his eyes wide open with surprise.
"Our country, did you say, Fatina?"
Then he was lost in thought again.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/im_234.jpg" width="389" height="423" alt="Geppetto" />
</div>

<p>While the old man was bending over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
Pinocchio, Fatina and Bersaglierino quietly
slipped out of the door. Papa Geppetto
was again alone with his beloved puppet
in the same room where he had first carved
the little fellow out of pine wood.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span></p>

<p>Don't you remember how Pinocchio first
broke up everything before he ran away?
How he knocked over the chest, rummaged
the wardrobe, broke the mirror, upset the
little table, turned over the chairs, pulled
the pictures off the walls, and tore down
the window-curtains? And don't you remember
how he left everything in a mess
and ran out into the street wrapped in a
flowered chintz curtain?</p>

<p>Well, Pinocchio was home again, and Papa
Geppetto had long ago repaired the things
Pinocchio had broken. Everything was in
good order except Pinocchio himself. That
was what worried the old man. He did not
care much about the mirrors, wardrobes, or
window-curtains, but he <i>did</i> care about his
little puppet friend whom he loved.</p>

<p>It was getting dark and old Geppetto
sat down in a large armchair and held
Pinocchio on his lap. As the shadows
began to gather and the room to get darker,
Papa Geppetto began to nod and soon
closed his eyes. With his arms clasped
around Pinocchio, he went to sleep.</p>

<p>If you could now step quietly into the
room, you would see both of them asleep.
The old man's head was resting on Pinocchio's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
head, and Pinocchio's on Geppetto's
shoulder.</p>

<p>The little puppet was sleeping quietly,
but the old man was not. He seemed to
be having a bad dream, judging from his
sighs and groans.</p>

<p>"Oh, Pinocchio!" he said, aloud, in his
sleep, "why did you run away and go to
the war? Just look at you! No legs, and
one arm gone! I wish you were my dear
wooden puppet again."</p>

<p>Then the old man sighed, but kept on
sleeping.</p>

<p>After about two hours Papa Geppetto
awoke. It was now quite dark, but not
so dark that the old man could not see
that some change had come over Pinocchio.
He looked down at the little sleeping puppet
and what do you think he saw? Not
artificial legs and an arm. Oh no! Pinocchio
was just as he was when he was
first made. Pinocchio was again the little
wooden puppet!</p>

<p>Papa Geppetto was so overcome with joy
that he caught up Pinocchio in his arms
and hugged him so tight he nearly smothered
the little fellow. And Pinocchio threw
his arms around the old man's neck and
kissed the top of his bald head.</p>
